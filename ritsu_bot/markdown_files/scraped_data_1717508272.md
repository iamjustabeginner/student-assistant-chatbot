*Specify your current home address and the commuting route on the enrollment confirmation label on your student ID card.

#### Required items

*You cannot purchase a student commuter pass unless the sticker for the academic year in question is not attached to the bottom of the enrollment confirmation label on the back of your student ID card and your current home address and commuting route are specified on the label.  
(The enrollment confirmation label on the back side functions as a student commuter certificate)
