# Research Ethics Education

#### Research Ethics Education

As graduate students, in order to ensure that you are able to conduct research freely in a manner consistent with academic integrity, you should have a good understanding of research ethics, including the code of conduct required for researchers, as well as knowledge of the proper methods for presenting research results.

It is very important for you to have fundamental knowledge of research ethics, increased awareness of the necessity and significance of learning research ethics, and the ability to recognize research ethics as your own issue to work on. By doing so, you can avoid being unwittingly involved in ethical misconduct.

Ritsumeikan University has been educating students on research ethics through guidance by research supervisors, regular courses of studies, and extracurricular seminars, while reminding students of risks related to research misconduct, such as falsification and plagiarism, etc. at orientations for new students. Building on such experience, the university conducts research ethics education for all graduate students.

For details of the research ethics education, please see the information from the "Graduate Student Career Path Support Center" website.
