Question: I have a chronic illness (or an injury or illness currently being treated). Can I study abroad?

Answer:
Even if you have a chronic illness (or an injury or illness currently being treated), you can still apply to study abroad programs. However, after you decide to participate in a study abroad program, you must report your health condition. Based on your declared information, the school doctor at the Medical Service Center will check whether your health condition allows you to study abroad. If necessary, the school doctor may communicate with participants or their doctors.

*For inquiries, please contact the study abroad staff at the International Center.

Living abroad is completely different from living in Japan. Also, because the medical systems in other countries often have many differences from the Japanese system, it is important to pay close attention to managing your health. If you have a chronic disease or an injury/illness currently being treated, please consult with your primary doctor in advance about studying abroad.

The International Center provides information regarding health management during a study abroad program guidance sessions for study abroad participants prepared by school doctors from the Medical Service Center.
