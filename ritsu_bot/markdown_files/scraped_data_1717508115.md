Question: I have received my Certificate of Eligibility (COE) but I have not been able to apply for my visa at the nearest embassy (consulate). Is that okay? 

Answer:
When you are able to apply for your visa at the nearest embassy (consulate), please do so.

If three months pass AFTER the issuance date listed on the Certificate of Eligibility (whicn means expired), please refer to the "zendesk" website.
