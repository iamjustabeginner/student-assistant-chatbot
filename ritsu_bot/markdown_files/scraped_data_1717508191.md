Question: When should I submit qualification certificates such as language proficiency test scores, etc.?

Answer:
Various qualification certificates (e.g., language scores, etc.) must be submitted when applying for a study abroad program. Therefore, you will not be able to apply if you do not meet the application requirements of the program at the time of application (i.e., your application will not be qualified to be screened).
