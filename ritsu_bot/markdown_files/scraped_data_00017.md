**AY2024 ISSE Graduation Research Student Allocation (approved by the course meeting on May 17, 2024)**

**Policy**

Students  are  distributed  evenly  to  each  of  these  ISSE  labs:  profs  Chandler,  Cooper,  Goncharenko, Kryssanov, and Serdult’s laboratories. No students will be assigned to Prof. Svinin’s lab (owing to his retirement at the end of AY2024).

**Method STUDENTS:**

Each ISSE student will indicate his/her laboratory preferences for all five ISSE labs, in the order of preference from the most preferred first:  

1st choice Laboratory (most preferred) 2nd choice Laboratory

3rd choice Laboratory  

... and so on, for all the five labs.

For the three most preferred labs, the student must briefly (up to 50 words) describe reasons for selecting the lab.

To ensure even distribution of students in the college, the number of ISSE course students to be assigned to each lab will be determined before assignment.

Lab assignment will be based in part on each of these factors: lab preference, GPA, and the number of students to be allocated to each lab (i.e. lab’s quota).

**PROFESSORS:**

The bottom 15% of students (the exact number will be adjusted to ensure even distribution), based on GPA, are equally distributed among the five ISSE labs, while considering the students’ preferences as much as possible.

Next, each ISSE laboratory head will first select the students who indicated the given lab as the lab of the first choice until the allocated limit is filled in order from highest GPA.

The remaining vacancies for the labs are filled with students from the 2nd choice list in the same way, and so on.

In cases where, for any reason, it is not possible to fill vacancies for a lab, based solely on student preferences,  a  random  draw  will  be  conducted  to  fill  all  the  lab  quotas,  while  considering  student preferences as much as possible.

**Dates of Information Sessions for ISSE students:**

The Information Session will be conducted on: 

**May 28** (Tue), from 12:20 to 12:50, at H708 

**May 30** (Thu), from 18:20 to 18:50, at H708

Open labs will be held during the period of June 3 to June 12 according to the schedule of each lab.

**Policy related to students who has not indicated their preferences by the college- wide deadline**

Students who fail to record at Manaba R+ her/his laboratory assignment preferences for conducting graduation research by the college-wide deadline are required to submit an explanation letter to the course director (or the course deputy-director if the director is unavailable). The letter must be addressed to the ISSE Course Director, must be signed by the student, and should contain the following: 

1) a clear explanation of why the preferences were not recorded as required, 
1) a pledge to abide all the college and course regulations and rules, and 
1) a pledge to strictly follow directions and guidance by the head of the laboratory the student would be assigned to for conducting graduation research. 

The letter submission deadline is decided by the course director. 

Failure to submit such a letter by the deadline may result in the student not being admitted to conduct graduation research.
