The Ritsumeikan Charter 

Ritsumeikan traces its roots to Prince Saionjiʼs private academy of the same name, established in 1869. It was officially founded in 1900 by his protégé, Kojuro Nakagawa, as the Kyoto Hosei Gakko (Kyoto School of Law and Politics), later to take on the name "Ritsumeikan." The name is derived from a passage in the Jinxin chapter of the Discourses of Mencius, and means "a place to establish one's destiny through cultivating one's mind. 

"Ritsumeikanʼs  founding  ideals  are  "freedom  and  innovation"  and  reflecting  upon  its  wartime  experience,  it committed itself to a core educational philosophy of "peace and democracy" after World War II. 

Ritsumeikan has faced the challenges of the times by pursuing an independent path to rise above adversity and has become the comprehensive private educational institution that it is today through extensive cooperation and support from both within and outside Japan.  

Ritsumeikan, as a Japanese institution located in the Asia Pacific region, is committed to sincerely reflecting upon history and to building an institution where many cultures coexist in the spirit of international mutual understanding. 

Ritsumeikan will build relationships of trust, through research and education, as well as sports and cultural activities, and establish its roots in the local community, to create an academic institution open to international society. 

Ritsumeikan will strive to strengthen links with society and promote its institutional development by fully utilizing the characteristics of a private academic institution, the participation of its faculty, staff and students, and the support of alumni and parents, while respecting the principles of autonomy, democracy, transparency, non-violence and justice.  

Ritsumeikan will pursue the creation of universal values based on academic freedom and search for solutions to the pressing issues facing humankind, with its educational endeavors based on its founding spirit and educational ideals, bearing in mind “to believe in the future, to live for the future.”  

Ritsumeikan will foster learning and the development of individual talents in order to nurture just and ethical global citizens. 

Ritsumeikan, as an institute of education and research, pledges to promote peace, democracy and sustainable development in Japan and throughout the world, in keeping with the spirit of this Charter.

4. Curriculum Policy

The Curriculum Policy provides the basic guidelines on what kinds of educational programs to establish and educational content/methods to implement, and how to evaluate learning outcomes in order to accomplish the diploma policy.

The curriculum of the College of Information Science and Engineering is designed to cultivate human resources with broad foundational knowledge in information science, advanced expertise and creativity in highly specialized fields, and the capacity to play active roles internationally. The College is composed of one Department and seven Courses, with students extending their studies by reference to common basic knowledge in order to acquire a balance between broad fundamental knowledge relevant across different specialized fields and high-level expertise in their own field, as required to sustain the greatly expanded discipline of information science into the future. The six Courses offered in a Japanese-language medium (System Architect, Security and Networks, Frontier Social Design, Physical Computing, Audio and Visual Media Technology, Artificial and Natural Intelligence) each provide detailed coverage of learning in their respective fields, which have grown deep and diverse in content. In addition, there is an Information Systems Science and Engineering Course offered in an English-language medium, in which eveny student studies specialized content across a variety of information-related fields, with emphasis placed on the development of internationally-capable human resources.

In the spring semester of their first year of study, students learn content common across the discipline of information science, while also deepening their understanding of individual fields of research within the discipline. They begin their specialized studies from the fall semester of first year, when they are each assigned to his or her own Course. In their assigned Courses students receive specialized education from expert faculty members in the applicable field, while also undertaking studies in common fields of information science essential for all people working with information, and related fields offering connections with other Courses. In order to promote the acquisition of solid professional capabilities and communicative proficiencies, the College operates a systematic course progression system that specifies conditions for progression to the next level of study and eligibility to undertake graduation research subjects.

In order to achieve the College’s educational objective through systematic study and educational practice, individual subjects are classified into three types—Foreign Language, Liberal Arts Education, and Major Education—and Major Education subjects further into Major Foundation, Major Common, Major Specific, and Global Career Development. Foreign Language, Liberal Arts Education, and Global Career Development subjects are designed to equip students with the communicative proficiencies needed to be active internationally. Major Foundation, Major Common, and Major Specific subjects develop high-level specialist abilities. The purpose of each subject category is outlined below.

1) **Foreign Language Subjects**

   Students study English exclusively, raising their practical proficiency in academic English centered on the four key skills of Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. Some English language subjects are also offered in order to develop proficiency in professional communication.



2) **Liberal Arts Subjects**

   The aim of General Education is to furnish broad-based knowledge and a solid outlook  on the world, thereby enabling students to develop intelligence, wisdom, and value outlooks  that will guide them through life. A diverse range of subjects are offered that provide understanding of a world made up of the natural environment and human society and help students expand their studies in specialized fields. Areas covered include science, nature, work, social service, sports, society, culture, and study abroad. General Education also cultivates the value outlooks necessary for broad-based reflection on the knowledge systems and values of Major Education.

3) **Major Education**

   Major subjects are divided into four groups in order to enable systematic study of the broad range of subjects that are now covered in field of information science. The Major Foundation category comprises subjects in mathematics and natural sciences which are important in order to cultivate the fundamental capabilities necessary to study more advanced major subjects in information science. There is also a careful selection of subjects in applied mathematics, especially essential in order for students to tackle specialized subjects in information-related areas. Common material that all people working in those areas should master is covered in the Major Common subject group. Information subjects, which form part of this group, provide a careful selection of important foundational material for all areas of information science. Major Specialized subjects build on the foundations provided by Major Foundation and Major Common subjects, covering material specific to each Course. The distinctive subjects in the Major Specialized group strongly reflect the specialization of the Course under which they are offered. Classes are taught not only in a lecture format, but also through practice-based studies through laboratory work, seminars, and graduation research, enabling students to develop a more profound understanding of the specialized field of their respective Courses. Each Course also offers programming-related subjects, and laboratory/seminar-style small-group subjects are also offered in each semester without fail. In the Global Career Development group, multiple subjects are offered for different purposes and taken by students in line with their career planning. The aim of these subjects is to respond to demands for diverse learning as well as to elevate career consciousness.

5. Achievement Objectives by Year Level

5. Systematic Course Progression!

In order to achieve its human resource development aims, the College of Information Science and Engineering has a curriculum designed to enable students to study systematically across all four years of enrollment. Known as Systematic Course Progression, this system is outlined in the figure below.


1. **Course Selection**  Students enrolled through a global entrance examination stream are automatically **(Course Change)** assigned to the Information Systems Science and Engineering Course. They cannot request placement in a Japanese-medium Course.

**Changing Courses**

It is not possible to change from the Information Systems Science and Engineering Course to a Course offered in a Japanese medium.

Eligibility for Course change is restricted as follows:

・Students must in principle have earned at least 80 credits with a GPA of at least 4.0. ・A decision will be only made following an interview with faculty members.

2. **Advancement System** As well as providing curriculum models for each Course to enable students to learn systematically, there is a system for checking students’ credit records and certain stages and providing advice as necessary. This system enables students to develop fundamental academic skills in their first two years of study before going on to deepen their specialized knowledge later. The prerequisite for advancement to third year is shown below.
Overall number of credits earned (counting toward graduation requirements): 50 credits

* If you fail to satisfy this prerequisite at the end of your second year, you will not be permitted to advance to third year and will be re-enrolled as a second year student.
* In some subjects, credits are not finalized until April of the following year and are thus awarded retrospectively. However, in such cases it is still not possible retrospectively to alter the outcome of the decision regarding advancement to third year.
3. **Allocation to Research**  In the spring semester of their third year of study, students are assigned to research **Labs and Graduation**  labs, and must take the subject Graduation Research 1. However, if on the basis of grades **Research 1** obtained in spring semester a student has no prospect of being able to take Graduation Research 2 or 3 in the following year, the student may withdraw from Graduation Research 1 following consultation with the faculty member in charge of their graduation research. Even in such cases of withdrawal, the student will remain affiliated with their research lab and will take Graduation Research in the fall semester of the following year. The schedule for research lab allocations will be announced around the beginning of June.
* Students who had changes in their student registry status or who have repeated a student year during their enrollment year may be eligible for research lab allocations in spring semester of their second year. Details will be announced to applicable students.

* If you do not satisfy these conditions you will not be eligible to take Graduation Research 2/3, but you will still progress through the year levels of the Course as normal.
* You must have completed Graduation Research 2 in order to take Graduation Research 3.
6. Small-Group Education

One feature of Ritsumeikan University’s educational approach is small-group education, which is pursued from the standpoints of “activation of self-directed, collective learning,” “formation of disciplinary outlooks and establishment of learning styles,” and “cultivation of autonomous capabilities.” Major subjects in the College of Science and Engineering include “small-group subjects” operated in classes of 35–40 students. These subjects vary from Course to Course, but at least one subject is offered in each semester.

In the spring semester of students’ first year of study, small-group subjects play an important introductory role in equipping students with information literacy and communicative skills. From the fall semester of first year through the spring semester of third year, the small-group subjects offered in each Course include laboratory work and seminars. The Graduation Research 1–3 subjects, offered from fall semester of third year through fall semester of fourth year, are also nominated as small-group subjects and viewed as the culmination of the small-group education system.

Explanation and debates on the content of the university bulletin Ritsumeikan Style are also conducted in small-group classes. Furthermore, events and discussions held by each class contribute to the goals of “activation of self-directed, collective learning” and “cultivation of autonomous capabilities.” In this way, classes in small-group subjects build the foundations for learning at university, and are one of the basic components of university student life. By engaging actively in class activities, you can make your studies from now on more rewarding. Support is also provided by senior students (Oriters) in activities such as welcome events for newly-enrolling students.

**Small-Group Subjects offered in each Course**

- PC 301 & AL 302: passing grades in English 109 or English 110 (or 600+ in TOEIC and its equivalent)
- PC 303: passing grades in PC 301
- AL 304: passing grades in AL 302

If students should receive the failing grade in any of the mandatory subjects, they must re-take the failed subject(s) in the following semester, for up to 2 credits.

As an illustrative scenario: Suppose a student should fail in both PC 301 and AL 302 in the second semester. In the third semester, s/he must re-take PC 301 before taking PC 303 and AL 304, and only if this student is successful in obtaining the credits of PC 301, s/he can be enrolled in PC 303 and re-take AL 302 in the fourth semester. However, s/ he will have to wait until the fifth semester to complete the 10 credits by successfully obtaining 2 credits of AL 304.

In addition to these mandatory subjects, students can develop their English language proficiency necessary in their specialized fields by taking one, or both, of the two optional subjects, i.e., Presentation Plus (P+) 401 and Writing for Publication (WP) 402. As the titles of these optional courses indicate, their foci are specific: P+ 401 focuses on presentation and communication skills called for in academic or specialized conferences or meetings; WP 402 develops skills for writing research papers. Students must complete PC 303 to be enrolled in P+ 401, and AL304 to be in WP 402.

2. Liberal Arts Subjects (for newly enrolled students in AY 2022)

College of Information Science and Engineering Academic Handbook 2022—AY2022 Enrollment—　15

1. **Philosophy and Goals of Ritsumeikan University’s Liberal Arts Education**

Liberal arts education serves as the foundation for the growth of each student during their campus life. In each undergraduate college, students deepen their knowledge through specialized education. The aim of Liberal Arts is for students to look at knowledge as a  whole from a wide range of fields, and broaden their perspectives. Liberal arts education  also strives to enable students to acquire intelligence and wisdom and develop a set of  values that will guide them throughout their life. Students should deepen their learning in order to grasp social issues as if they were their own, acquire an outlook that can put their specialized knowledge in to perspective, and grow into a global citizen who can live in cooperation with others.

Based on this philosophy, three goals have been set.
College of Information Science and Engineering Academic Handbook 2022—AY2022 Enrollment—　15

**Goals of Liberal Arts Education**



|[Goal I] Knowledge/ Understanding|To enable students to acquire the ability to put their own expertise into perspective and examine it through a system of knowledge and methodology different from the specialized education provided in each college.|
| :-: | - |
|[Goal II] Thinking/ Judgement/ Consciousness|To enable students to cultivate the intelligence, wisdom, set of values, and ways of thinking that will guide them throughout their life by acquiring a well-rounded education and deep insight.|
|[Goal III] Attitude/ Behavior|To cultivate the skills needed to shape modern society and enable students to acquire the ability to learn autonomously given the need to work with people with a variety of values.|

2. **Liberal Arts Education Attainment Objectives and Curriculum Map**  More specific attainment objectives that correspond to the three goals stated in 2.1  have been set. This curriculum map shows which subjects correspond to which goals. Use the curriculum map to design a balanced study plan. (Refer to 2.6 Liberal Arts Subjects List and Curriculum Map.)


3. **Groupings/ Area Structure of Liberal Arts Subjects and Number of Credits Required for Graduation**
3. **Outline of Each Subject Group**


|Subjects|Graduation Requirement||
| - | - | :- |
|Liberal Arts Education|Group B subjects (general international education subjects)|14 credits or more|

* Students in the Information Systems Science and Engineering Course are not permitted to take subjects other than those in Group B (general international education subjects). Only Group B subjects (general international education subjects) are shown below.

  ISSE students taking a teacher training programs must take liberal arts subjects other than those in Group B. Please refer to the “V. Teacher Training Programs” for details.

**Group B Subjects (general international education subjects) International Liberal Arts Subjects (Group B Liberal Arts Courses)**

Group B consists of subjects where classes are delivered in non-Japanese languages, such as English, for fostering a wide range of knowledge and communication capabilities through learning basic matters in humanity, social sciences, and natural sciences necessary for establishing firm perspectives regarding humans and the world. There are also subjects that are mainly provided for students who aim to study abroad so their foreign language proficiency may be fully utilized, whereas their understanding of different cultures would be enhanced. International Liberal Arts Subjects (Group B Liberal Arts Courses) intend to lay the foundations for cultivating mutual intercultural understanding, which is vital in a globalized world.

International Liberal Arts Subjects (Group B Liberal Arts Courses) consist of three course categories: “International Liberal Arts Subjects,” “Intercultural Exchange Subjects,” and “Study Abroad Subjects.”

17

**[International Liberal Arts Subjects]**

The subjects in this category include those where the students can learn matters across the areas of humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences provided by highly specialized lecturers, and in English or in other elementary level non-Japanese languages, in exercise style or in lecture style. Among these subjects, “Theme Study” is provided for small-group classes of 20 to 35 participants where group discussions are held and presentations are made in a proactive manner, and where mutual learning between students from different colleges, grades, and cultural backgrounds is ensured. The subjects are intended to foster a wide range of intelligence and communication capabilities, and establish firm perspectives regarding humans and the world.

**[Intercultural Exchange Subjects]**

The subjects in this category are those where an international perspective can be fostered via communication between students from different cultural and historical backgrounds. There are subjects such as “Cross-cultural Encounters” and “Basic Communication Skills,” in which students can learn communication between different cultures and understanding of others by learning communication and the sense of value from the perspective of spoken languages, and “Advanced Seminar,” in which understanding toward different cultures will be promoted by mutual studying via group work between Japanese and international students for the themes regarding global matters and other matters that would lead to forming future careers.

**[Study Abroad Subjects]**

The subjects in this category are provided for students who aim to, or are scheduled to, study abroad for half a year or an entire year. Subjects include preparatory subjects required for studying at universities overseas. There are subjects such as “Basic Academic Skills” and “Intermediate Academic Skills,” in which students concentrate on obtaining the literacy required for studying abroad by utilizing the four language skills of “reading, listening, writing, and speaking” in a comprehensive manner in addition to the regular foreign language studies offered by the college, and “Intermediate Seminar,” in which students learn practical basic knowledge and academic skills by utilizing the four skills in a comprehensive manner based on the learning gained through the former two subjects (classes may be offered for international students as well).



5. **Liberal Arts Subject Categories**  Liberal arts subjects are categorized into three groups based on eligible student year; Introductory, Established, and Advanced (Reference: 2.7 Liberal Arts Subjects List and Curriculum Map). Refer to the following table when formulating your study plan.

|Introductory|<p>These courses are strongly recommended for underclassman. Please note that only 1st-year students, or 1st- and 2nd-year students are allowed to take these courses. 3rd- year students and above are not allowed to take them. The courses are as follows.</p><p>- 1st-year students: “Learning problem-solving with society”</p><p>- 1st- and 2nd-year students: “Ritsumeikan in Japanese Modern History,” “Peer Support Studies,” “Media and Libraries,” “Career Based Learning,” “National Administrative Organizations,” “Cross-cultural Encounters 1,” “Introduction to Service Learning,” “Modern Society and Volunteer Activities”</p>|
| - | - |
|Established|These are courses that accomplish the diversity of liberal arts education. All subjects other than “Introductory” and “Advanced” fall into the “Established” category. Students 1st-year and above, or 2nd-year and above are eligible to take these subjects. (There are some exceptions.)|
|Advanced|This course is for 3rd-year students and above who have completed their specialized education at their college. Only one course, “Trans-disciplinary Liberal Arts,” is offered that allows students to take an advanced, interdisciplinary approach that transcends the boundaries of disciplines to address the challenges humans are facing.|


(Important Points)

- Only regular and short-term international students can take the “Subjects about Japanese Affairs, etc.” courses that aim to deepen their understanding of Japan from various perspectives.
- There are 4 “Stages” of International Liberal Arts Subjects (Group B). “Stage” refers to the language level students taking the class are assumed to have achieved and the degree of involvement in international exchange. In order to take these courses, students need to have language skills equivalent to the “Stage” stipulated for the class. Please check the syllabus for the relevant “Stage.” In order to take introductory second foreign language classes, stage 4 or above of the language proficiency certification of each language is required.

1. **Major Foundation**  The Major Foundation group comprises subjects on numeracy and natural sciences, **Subjects** and subjects on mathematics. In particular, the mathematics subjects cover matters necessary for mathematical expression and analysis of information itself, understanding of methods of information processing, and analysis and monitoring of information systems. Major Foundation subjects are important for the cultivation of foundational knowledge  required to study more advanced major subjects in the College of Information Science and Engineering. You will make use of the knowledge acquired in these subjects not only in other subjects in the major but also in your graduation research.
1. **Major Common Subjects**  The Major Common group includes subjects in information science, and global IT, which should be acquired by all people involved in information-related fields, regardless of their specific course of study. Information science subjects include those designed to develop the communication skills demanded of information technologists, and core subjects for the study of computer hardware and software. The study of information ethics, information literacy, information gathering and searching, presentation skills, and academic writing is also undertaken from first year level. Furthermore, with a view to responding to the demands of globalization, some information science subjects are offered in both Japanese and English. It is possible to take these subjects in English provided conditions such as English language proficiency requirements and class quotas are met.

In Presentation Plus 401 and Writing for Publication 402, students already equipped with adequate English language proficiency develop skills for making presentations at international conferences and writing articles for publication in international academic journals.

**Points to note when registering for subjects**

Major Common subjects (information science subjects) are designated as second-year level subjects, but the recommended year level for taking these subjects varies depending on the Course you are enrolled in. You should therefore check the curriculum chart for your Course before registering.

3. **Major Specific Subjects**  Major Specific subjects are offered in the specialized areas covered by each course, and build on the foundations provided by Major Foundation and Major Common subjects. As well as reinforcing those foundations in preparation for specialized learning in the Course, these subjects impart knowledge of programming languages and methods. By taking more advanced subjects in the specialist field of their Course, students gain a deeper understanding of their field. At the same time, laboratory and seminar activities build practical capabilities for application in information technology settings in wider society. Furthermore, students in the fall semester of third year begin work on their graduation research, and complete a graduation thesis, the culmination of their four years of undergraduate study, in the fall semester of fourth year. Graduation research brings students into contact with cutting-edge information technologies and provides them with experience in identifying and analyzing research problems, proposing solutions, and evaluating those solutions.
3. **Global Career Development Subjects**  The purpose of Global Career Development subjects is to enable students to think  about what it might mean for them to work in the future, and to enhance their career consciousness and pursue their studies in a self-directed, pro-active manner. There are four subject categories: the Career Development Program centered on careers education, the Global IT Program which enhances English language proficiency and instills an international outlook, the Information Qualifications Program for the acquisition of systematized skills essential to succeed as an IT technologist, and the MOT Introductory Program that connects advanced information technology with business management.

A diversity of learning needs are addressed through the provision of multiple subjects with different purposes. For example, students can listen directly to engineers and researchers invited from companies and other partners speaking on how university studies can be applied in wider society, and thereby gain opportunities to think deeply about the actual conditions and roles of information technology in society.

1\. Teacher Training Programs!

This chapter is written in Japanese since subjects in the Teacher Training Programs are generally only offered in Japanese, requiring participants to possess a corresponding level of Japanese language proficiency.

**Considerations Before Joining Teacher Training Programs**

Most colleges and departments at Ritsumeikan University offer Teaching Training Programs. Through such programs, students aspiring to become teachers are able to take teacher training courses through their college (if offered). If they successfully complete the required courses and receive credits, they will be able to apply for a teaching license at prefectural boards of education throughout Japan. However, it should be noted that most of these teaching course credits do not count towards the credits needed to graduate from the student’s respective college, which in turn results in an increase in the student’s overall course load. If students only have a simple desire to get a teaching license, they should realize that taking these courses may make their regular college studies more difficult and that they may not be able to obtain their desired teaching license at the time of graduation. Therefore, students are strongly urged to have a clear sense of purpose before choosing to join such programs.

**Ⅵ．Student Support Systems**

1\. Voluntary seminars support system
