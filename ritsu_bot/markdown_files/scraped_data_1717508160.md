Question: Do I need to have a medical check-up before studying abroad?

Answer:
In order to participate in a study abroad program, you must have received the annual health examination conducted by the Medical Service Center. If you did not receive the health examination for whatever reason, you will have to have a separate health checkup by a designated date.
