Question: I was accepted for a tuition reduction, but I am planning to take a leave of absence. What will happen to my tuition reduction? 

Answer:

The tuition reduction will be applied only for the semester in which the application is submitted and/or the following semester. In order to be eligible for the tuition reduction, your enrollment status must be registered as "current student (zaigaku)" or "study abroad (ryuugaku)".

If you take a leave of absence, the tuition reduction will not be applied to that semester, nor will it be deferred.
