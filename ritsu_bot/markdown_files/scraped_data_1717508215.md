**Biwako-Kusatsu Campus (BKC)**

## International Student Dormitory

### BKC International House

In September 2012, Biwako-Kusatsu Campus opened a new dormitory for international students, immediately adjacent to campus. This state of the art facility sits in a quiet neighborhood, so it offers students both a peaceful setting and the convenience of close proximity to all of the university's facilities. The BKC International House aims to help international students transition to living in Japan while providing an environment where students can adjust to the local language and culture as well as interact with fellow scholars from around the world.

#### Features

・5 minutes from campus on foot, using secure commuter route  
・24-hour English-speaking management  
・Bilingual Resident Mentors (RMs)
