# Leave of Absence

**Requirements for Leave of Absence**

If a student is unable to attend classes for more than two consecutive months due to illness or other unavoidable reasons during the period from the first day of classes to the last day of final examinations of the semester, the student may file a request to take a leave of absence. Their college will determine whether the request is accepted. A student determined to be unfit to attend classes due to an illness may be ordered to take a leave of absence. Deliberation on a leave of absence may take from two weeks to nearly one month depending on the faculty council schedule. Please note the following points regarding the leave of absence period:

1. The leave of absence period does not count toward the total enrollment period.

2. The leave of absence period should not exceed two consecutive years but may be extended by a maximum of one year with the approval of the University under special circumstances.

3. The leave of absence period should not exceed a total of three years since the initial admission to the University. (Applies to students admitted from AY 2010.)

For example, if a student takes a leave of absence for 2 years in AY 2020 and AY 2021, re-enrolls in AY 2022, and takes another leave of absence for 1 year in AY 2023, the student is not permitted to take any more leave of absence.

4. Students are exempt from having to pay tuition while on a leave of absence; however, they are required to pay a matriculation fee instead.

**Procedures for Taking a Leave of Absence**

To request the leave of absence, students must consult with the administrative office of their college (OIC: Manabi Station) . Check information on consulting and applying to the office.

(2) Deadline to submit documents and dates of leave of absence

Students must submit their request for a leave of absence by the dates listed below. Leaves of absence are granted in units of one academic semester or one year. If a student receives permission to take a leave of absence after the semester or academic year starts, the specified start date of the leave of absence is the date the student is permitted to begin their leave of absence. However, the period of time between the day the semester or academic year starts and the day before the specified start date for the leave of absence is also counted as part of the total leave of absence period.

**Leave of Absence Period: Submission Deadline**
Spring semester or whole year: By May 31  
Fall semester: By November 30

* In principle, a request for a leave of absence immediately after the student enrolls or re-enrolls (during the same semester) in the University will be accepted only in cases where there are unavoidable circumstances due to illness. Furthermore, taking another leave of absence immediately after re-enrollment (during the same semester) will not be permitted except for unavoidable circumstances such as illness.
* International students taking a leave of absence will lose their residence status of “Student.” Please consult with the International Center in advance.

**Procedures to End Leave of Absence Period**

The student is required to complete the procedures listed below. If the procedures are not completed by the end of the leave of absence period, the student will be removed from the student registry as of that date.
