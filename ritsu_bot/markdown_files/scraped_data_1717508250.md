# Student Identification Card (Student ID Card)

The student ID card is not only used to prove that you are a student of Ritsumeikan University, but also used in your daily college life such as for the use of facilities in the University or the confirmation of class attendance via the IC card reader. Please carry your student ID card with you every day and be careful not to lose it.

An enrollment confirmation label must be attached to the back of the student ID card. The last day of the semester of the required standard enrollment period for graduation or completion is printed on the label for the back of your student ID card. Student ID card without the label on the back will be invalid.

Only students who need to purchase a commuter pass will receive a sticker with the relevant academic year printed on the 'Route' and 'Student Commuter Pass Issuance Slip' sections. The sticker must be replaced every academic year, so students who need this sticker should ask for it at the Manabi Station.

*The stickers for AY 2024 will be distributed starting March 25, 2024.

Structure of Student ID Number (11 digits)（the digits refers to the following.）

* Student ID numbers may change if a student transfers to another major or is readmitted.
