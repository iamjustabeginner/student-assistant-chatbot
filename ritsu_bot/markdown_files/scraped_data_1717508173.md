Question:When will I pay the study abroad program fee?

Answer:
Information regarding program fee payment will be announced during the guidance session for successful applicants.

In general, you will have to pay the program application fee within one week after passing the screenings, and the remaining amount after subtracting the program application fee from the total program cost will need to be paid one month to two weeks before departure. It is necessary to pay tuition to the university regardless of the program fee payment. Please make tuition payments following the procedure provided by RUâ€™s Division of Financial Affairs.
