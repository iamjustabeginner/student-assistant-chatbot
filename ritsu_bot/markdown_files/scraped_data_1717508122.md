Question: The results of tuition reduction have not yet been announced, but I have already received my tuition invoice. Am I allowed to pay tuition after the results have been announced?

Answer:
Beginning with the 2022 academic year, we will be able to announce the results of tuition fee reductions to students prior to the tuition payment deadline.  
(For the spring semester of 2022, the results will be announced in mid-May.)

  
For this reason, we recommend that tuition payment be made after the announcement of the results of tuition reduction, and after confirming the tuition fee after the reduction has been applied on CAMPUS WEB, etc.

  
If it is difficult to pay the full amount in a lump sum, payment can be made in installments.
