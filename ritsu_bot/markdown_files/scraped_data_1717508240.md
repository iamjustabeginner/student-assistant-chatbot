### Special consideration for absence other than official absence

Consideration shall be given in the case of absence from class due to (1)bereavement (spouse and relatives within the second degree), or (2) natural disasters (storm, heavy rain, flood, storm surge, earthquake, tsunami, eruption and other extreme natural phenomena), other than “official absence.” Because such an absence is different from “official absence,” the absence is counted as non-attendance. However, please apply for a special arrangement. Class instructors shall do the following as far as possible, so that the student can smoothly learn what they should study.

  * Handouts distributed in class
  * Information on what was covered in class as well as the key points in class
  * Instructions on self-study content
  * Academic guidance and support relating to classes such as making substitute arrangements for reports or small quizzes that the student missed.

As for (2) attendance or non-attendance in the event of a natural disaster, the principle is that each student makes a decision giving priority to safety, depending on the situation of his/her area of residence and commuting area, even if classes are not cancelled at the campus or the entire university. Based on this perspective, in the case of unavoidable non-attendance due to natural disasters, the University asks class instructors to make sure that such non-attendance does not cause disadvantage in academic assessment, in addition to the above arrangements.

Please follow the following procedure when requesting a special arrangement:

#### In the case of absence due to bereavement

Please submit an official certificate of death (a death certificate etc., or a thank you letter for attending a funeral is also possible) to the class instructor.

#### In the case of absence due to natural disasters

Please check acceptance of the special arrangements with regard to classes in the following order.  
*If there is any instructions in class or on manaba+R on how to submit the form other than the following, please follow the instruction and apply in accordance with its contents.
  * 1.First, check “Surveys” for the relevant subject in the course on manaba+R to see if there is a survey for the relevant natural disasters.   
* Acceptance of an application via manaba＋R may take time before being posted, because this method is an emergency response due to natural disasters. Please continue to check it until the next class.
  * 2.If there is a survey, fill it out and submit it.
3.If there is no survey or the reply deadline of the survey has passed, fill out the following form and submit it to the class instructor.
  
If there is any point to be confirmed in the information on the application, class instructors may ask the student to submit an official certificate such as a certificate of delay.

### Handling of the case that a student is infected with an infectious disease specified in the School Health and Safety Act

For infectious diseases specified in the School Health and Safety Act, please check the following and follow the procedures on the Medical Service Center website.

Although "officially approved absence" does not apply to the student who is unable to attend class due to a "suspension", the class instructor will do the followings as much as possible to enable the student to learn the content of class for which the attendance has been suspended smoothly.

  * Handouts distributed in class
  * Information on what was covered in class as well as the key points in class
  * Instructions on self-study content
  * Academic guidance and support relating to classes such as making substitute arrangements for reports or small quizzes that the student missed.
