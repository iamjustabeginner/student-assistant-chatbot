**Conditions for Passing**

- Requirements to Enter Year 3
- Must have attained 50 graduation required credits by the end of 2nd year Fall Semester
- To take Graduation Research 2, 3 (from 4th year only), students must satisfy these requirements
- Attained at least 96 total credits toward graduation 
- Attained at least 6 Language credits
- Completed Programming Practice 1+2, Graduation Research 1

**Mandatory Subjects - Importance**
Mandatory subjects for the ISSE course (must be completed for graduation)
- Programming Practice 1,2
- PBL 1,2,3,4,5
- Graduation Research – I, -II, -III
- Recommendation: do not be behind the curriculum tree schedule
- Reserve more time for Graduation Research and thesis writing
- Try to complete all PBL subjects before semester 6
- To take Graduation Research 2, 3 (from 4th year only), students must satisfy these requirements
- Completed Programming Practice 1+2, Graduation Research 1

**PBL distribution policy**

- **5 labs** in total (from AY2024, the number of ISSE labs could be increased)
- PBL 2: 
Random distribution depending on each lab quota

- PBL 5:
Assignment of students for PBL-5 is done, based on random draw. For PBL-5, students shall not be assigned to the same laboratory where they were during PBL-2.

**Lab entry policy**

- Main policy:

Each ISSE student will indicate his/her laboratory **preferences** preference from most preferred first (from AY2024, the number of ISSE labs could be increased).

For the three most preferred labs, the student should briefly (up to 50 words) describe reasons for selecting the lab.

Based on their preferences, students are assigned to each laboratory to fill the laboratory’s quota. When the number of students, who indicated a specific laboratory as the first choice, exceeds the laboratory’s quota, students with **higher GPA** will be assigned to the laboratory. The remaining students will then be assigned to other laboratories within each laboratory’s quota, based on their second (third, etc.) -choice preferences in a similar manner. Laboratory quotas are determined to ensure even distribution of students among laboratories in the college and to balance per-student research guidance time.

- Your preference list and explanation document is very important! Submit it, when required!
