# Join us for "Mirai Seminar" #8, a seminar based on student proposals.

To the students of Ritsumeikan University,

This is the office of Liberal Arts Center, Ritsumeikan University.
With the support of the Mitsubishi Mirai Nurturing Foundation, the Center has launched the "Future Co-creation Liberal Arts Seminar" (a.k.a. Mirai Seminar), a student-proposed seminar, in the fall semester of 2021. 

The Mirai Seminar is a student-proposed seminar where students continue to study topics of interest that have emerged from their studies in regular courses. The seminar is run by a group of students from different faculties and graduate schools, who belong to different campuses, in a cycle based on quarters (about 8 weeks).

Through face-to-face and online communication, why don't you expand your circle of friends to envision and design a better society for the future, and explore the words that will open up the next generation?

Currently, the following Mirai Seminar is looking for members.
If you are interested in joining, please apply.
