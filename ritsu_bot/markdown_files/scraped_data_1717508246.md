### ＧＰＡ

GPA is the quantified result by Ritsumeikan University’s unique conversion method to measure students’ academic achievement. GPA is used as criteria to qualify for various on-campus programs and screenings.

**Ritsumeikan University GPA Conversion Method**

(5 x # of **A +** credits)＋(4 x # of **A** credits )＋(3 x # of **B** credits)＋(2 x # of **C** credits)

Total # of registered credits for **A + A, B, C, and F**

  * ・Courses not included in the graduation requirements are not included in the GPA calculation.
  * ・Grades earned in a sub-major course will be included in the GPA calculation, even if the credits are not counted towards the credits required for the sub-major.

There are two types of GPA: Semester GPA and Cumulative GPA. Students can confirm them on the “Course Registration and Grade Status” screen of CAMPUS WEB. (They will not be included in the Transcript of Academic Record.)

### Credit Approval Period

The credit approval period varies depending on the semester that a course is held during. In order to receive the credits, a student must be “enrolled” or “studying abroad” during the Credit Approval Period. (If a student is on a “leave of absence,” credits will not be granted.)

### Approval of Credits Earned at Other Universities

#### Approval of Credits Earned at Other Universities

A maximum of 60 credits earned at other universities (transferred via a credit transfer system) or in study abroad programs may be approved as credits required for graduation from the University by the dean of the corresponding college after deliberation by the Faculty Council.

Please be aware that the 60-credit limit indicates the total credits a student can earn at other universities and not just at a single institution or program.

For credits earned in a study abroad program, students need to submit a document certifying credits earned, study period and grades and other required documents to the administrative office of the college (OIC: Manabi Station). Credits earned will be approved on the last day of the semester in which study abroad was completed.

*Students need to promptly submit a notification of completion of study abroad form (留学終了届) after returning to Japan.


#### Approval of Credits Earned before admission

Transfer credits earned in ways other than those mentioned in (1) before admission to the University also count toward the 60-credit limit mentioned above (of which a maximum of 30 credits earned before admission to the University can be approved).

#### Approval of Credits for Transfer Admission

Up to 30 credits for new 2nd year students, and up to 62 credits for new 3rd year students that were earned at other universities prior to transfer may be approved as credits required for graduation from Ritsumeikan University. The upper limit of approval of credits earned in the College of Science and Engineering, College of Information Science and Engineering, College of Life Sciences, and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences varies depending on the college.
