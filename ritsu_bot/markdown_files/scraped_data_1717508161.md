Question: Do I arrange my own accommodation at the study abroad location?

Answer:
For programs offered by the International Center, generally accommodation arrangements will be made directly or intermediated by the International Center (except for exchange programs, Global PBL and DUDP). Details will be provided in the application guidelines and during program guidance sessions.

*For inquiries, please contact the study abroad staff at the International Center.
