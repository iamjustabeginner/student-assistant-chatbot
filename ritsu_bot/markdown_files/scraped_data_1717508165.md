Question: Are there any rules and regulations for studying abroad?

Answer:
When studying abroad through a program offered by the International Center, participants and their guarantors are asked to confirm and sign a consent form. This is established as the minimum rule for you and other participants to study abroad safely and securely. Violation of the formâ€™s terms may result in being asked to return to Japan before the end of your study abroad or return received scholarships.

*For inquiries, please contact the study abroad staff at the International Center.
