# Course Registration

In Course Registration, students are required to register for courses they want to take (or need to take) during the specified period.
For a list of the courses to register for, please refer to your college’s “Academic Handbook,” “Registration Guidebook” and “Time Schedule/Syllabus.” Carefully read the course outline, teaching method, and student attainment objectives of courses stated in the Online Syllabus before attending the class.
