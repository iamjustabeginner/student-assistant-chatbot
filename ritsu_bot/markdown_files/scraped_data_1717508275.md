# Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives

In the R2030 Academy Vision, Ritsumeikan defined the ideal Academy as one “dedicated to realizing diversity and inclusion,” and is promoting diversity and inclusion (D&I) through various actions in order to create an organization where each and every member can learn, pursue research, and work with peace of mind.
