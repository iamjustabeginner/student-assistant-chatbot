Question: Why do International Students need to have their attendance confirmed every month? '

Answer:
This is because the university is required by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology to report any international students who have been absent for a long period of time.  
During these monthly checks, we confirm whether students are conducting study/research that corresponds to their "Student" status of residence.

Currently, we are setting monthly questionnaire for attendance confirmation on manaba+R.
