### Housing Guarantor System

Choosing an apartment is a very important step when starting your life as an international student. Generally, when you sign an apartment rental contract in Japan, a co-signer is required. When a co-signer is not available, you must use the services of a guarantor company. In order to ensure that our students can smoothly complete their contracts and begin their studies worry free, we recommend you use the guarantor company below. If you are an international student of Ritsumeikan University (regardless of visa status), you are eligible to utilize the guarantor company’s housing co-sign guarantee at a specially discounted rate.

When new international students arrive at Ritsumeikan University, the International Center organizes thorough orientations to start off the semester which include sessions outlining the procedures for resident registration, enrollment in health insurance, and opening bank accounts.  
  
After students receive assistance in filling out important public paperwork, the documents are submitted to the local administration on the students' behalf, or the students are escorted to the local public office to ensure the forms are submitted accordingly. Additionally, the International Center provides new students with a handbook for issues that arise in daily life and maps of the campus area so students are able to adjust to life in Japan as quickly as possible.
