Question: Will information sessions about study abroad programs be held?

Answer:
Application information sessions (Japanese only) are held one month to two weeks before the application period for each study abroad program. We also hold various seminars about studying abroad (Japanese only). Specific dates will be announced via manaba+R, notice boards at the International Center, and the application guidelines for each program.

For students who are not fluent in Japanese to attend these sessions, please contact the International Center for further information (mailto:ru-sa@st.ritsumei.ac.jp).
*For inquiries, please contact the study abroad staff at the International Center.
