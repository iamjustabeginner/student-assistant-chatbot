## International Student Support Coordinator

The International Student Support Coordinators handle a variety of inquiries related to international students’ student life. International students can visit them to voice any concerns, questions, or worries they may have, and the coordinator will offer advice and assistance, including liaising between the international student and other on and off-campus facilities if necessary to try and reach a solution.

  * “I want to participate in an extracurricular activity/ I want to ask about balancing extracurricular activities and part-time work” (extracurricular questions)
