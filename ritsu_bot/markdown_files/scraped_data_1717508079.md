Question: I heard that I can talk to the international student support coordinator to talk about my student life. Should I go to the service window? 


Answer:
If you would like to talk to the International Student Support Coordinator individually, please make a reservation using the booking form below.

Within 3 days (excluding Sat, Sun, and national holidays, summer/winter/spring vacation), we will send an email to your Ritsumeikan email address or the address submitted on this form. If you do not receive an email from us within 3 days, please contact "ru-issc@st.ritsumei.ac.jp".  
  

Please feel free to talk to her if you find it hard to adapt to a new environment, donâ€™t know where to turn and who to talk to, etc. Do not hesitate to make a reservation even if your worry is a small issue.
