Question: Are there restrictions on when I am allowed to do a part-time job? 

Answer:
Part-time jobs are permitted as long as they do not impede study, for up to 28 hours per week.

Moreover, students are permitted to work up to 8 hours per day / 40 hours per week during only long-term holidays designated in the school regulations (summer, winter, and spring breaks).
