Common Seminar Room Terms of Use 

Introduction 

The College of Information Science and Engineering has a variety of facilities and equipment to carry out education and learning. In Building H of OIC, we have a common seminar room (H805 and H806) that is mainly used for undergraduate seminar subjects. We have decided to open this room not only for regular classes, but also as a room for taking media classes and other self-study in order to work on the assignments of practices and experiments with classmates. Through the use of this room, we aim to enhance learning opportunities for students. 

As you can see, the Common Seminar Room is a room used by the whole College of Information Science and Engineering, so we have summarized the following rules and precautions to ensure that everyone can use the room comfortably. Therefore, please be sure to read it before using it and use it carefully so that you do not use it incorrectly or lose or damage the equipment in the room. If you see a student who is not following the rules, please talk to each other and try to make it comfortable for both of you as undergraduate and graduate students of the College of Information Science and Engineering and the Graduate School of Information Science and Engineering.
