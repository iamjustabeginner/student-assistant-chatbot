Question: Do I need to be vaccinated before studying abroad?

Answer:
The country or region (state) of destination may require specific vaccinations for study abroad students. In this case, you must be vaccinated before traveling.

Even if vaccination is not required, it may be recommended to prevent the spread of infectious diseases (on a voluntary basis). In addition, there is a Travel Clinic in the Medical Service Center on each of RUâ€™s campuses where you can get vaccinated. For details, please contact the Medical Service Center Travel Clinic.
