# [10/30 (Sat.)] SERIES Liberal Arts “Living in Economic Turbulence” Online Event

To All RU Undergraduate and Graduate Students,


“SERIES Liberal Arts ‘The Five Parts of Humanity’” is a project that poses the question of “What is it to be human, what is emotion, and what does it mean to live?” in order to take a multifaceted view of the unstable state of “I” within the polarized ends of such fields as “systems and individuals,” “emotion and reason,” etc. It considers this question within the themes of “Family,” “Food,” “Art,” “Town,” and “Economy,” while in conversation with a variety of experts.


The final part of the “The Five Parts of Humanity” is about the largest system ever created by humans, the economy.

◆ Outline:

In July of this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its latest World Economic Outlook. It showed that as the global economy continues to recover, the gap between developed countries and a number of emerging market economies/ developing countries is widening. The cause of this widening gap is largely reflected in each country’s pandemic trends.


In developed countries, nearly 40% of the population is fully vaccinated, compared to 11% in emerging market economies and even less in developing countries. While the earlier-than-expected arrival of a vaccine and normalization of economic activity allowed for an upward revision in economic growth, lack of access to vaccines and a new wave of infections dominated by the Delta variant led to a subsequent downward revision.


Looking at Japan, a state of emergency was declared even as the Olympic Games were being held. Based on the negative impacts of this restriction on people’s behavior, Japan had the largest downward revision of any developed country.


Was this increasing inequality and division brought about by COVID-19?

No, that’s probably not the case. Even before the pandemic, globalization had widened the gap and continues to do so today.


As of 2016, the international poverty alleviation NGO Oxfam reported that the world’s 62 richest individuals own assets that equal the value of the poorest half of humanity, or 3.6 billion people. It reported last year that the number of billionaires in the world (i.e., people with assets of $1 billion or more) has doubled in the past decade, with the richest 2,153 people having more wealth than the poorest 4.6 billion people, equivalent to over 60% of the world’s population.


Does more money make people happier?

A study by Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University in the U.S. showed that life satisfaction improves as income increases, but satisfaction plateaus once average annual income reaches $75,000.


If more money does not increase happiness, why is there no distribution of wealth?

Why do inequality and division continue to grow?

How should we confront this problem and how should we live going forward?


We would like to debate this question in conversation with experts in crisis theory, economic theory, and international economics as a summary of the SERIES Liberal Arts “The 5 Parts of Humanity” exploring the theme “What is intelligence for living freely?”
