Question: Is there any study abroad crisis management support?

Answer:
For study abroad programs offered by the International Center, participants are required to purchase an overseas travel insurance and register for risk management services (24-hour phone support and safety confirmation system). This provides a system to quickly respond to incidents/ accidents that occur while studying abroad.

*For inquiries, please contact the study abroad staff at the International Center.
