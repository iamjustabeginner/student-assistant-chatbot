### How to check cancelled classes, makeup classes, and classroom changes

Classes may be cancelled when the instructor in charge of the course is unable to attend due to illness or other reasons.  
In principle, makeup classes will be held on the established makeup class days. (Please refer to the academic calendar for the detailed schedule of the makeup classes.)  
Makeup classes format will be either face-to-face classes, media-based classes (live-streaming), or media-based classes (on-demand). This may differ from the normal implementation format.  

* In the event that classes cannot be held due to a disaster, etc., an established makeup class day may be scheduled on a day other than those specified in the academic calendar.  
* The makeup class may be set on other than the established makeup class days after guaranteeing students the opportunity to take the class.  
* Exams, quizzes, experiments, and important presentations may be given after guaranteeing students the opportunity to attend and take the tests (including web-based delivery).   
* If a makeup class overlaps on the established makeup class day, please attend one of the classes at your own discretion.

  * Have students place the Student ID Card in front of the IC card reader.

### Course Survey

Ritsumeikan University conducts the “course survey” (for courses offered by colleges) on manaba+R in the 13th to 15th weeks as activities for students and course instructors to not only exchange opinions regarding the expectations from a course and the learning attitude during a semester but also improve courses through mutual cooperation.When it comes time to conduct the survey, the notification will be displayed in “Courses” page of manaba+R, so please check it.

The results of the course survey will be used for future classes or academic improvement. In addition, after the survey is closed, overall results for each course and comments (feedback) from instructors will be posted on the online syllabus (for internal use)
