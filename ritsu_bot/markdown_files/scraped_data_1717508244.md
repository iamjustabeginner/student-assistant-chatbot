#### Notes for Final Examination

Final examinations are an important tool to check if students are meeting certain academic benchmarks. A student who cheated during a final examination is considered to have renounced their right to learn and will lose their right to study at the University. RU implements each examination with strict rules. Misconduct is subject to disciplinary action and if found will result in the student receiving an “F” grade in that subject and/or all subjects for the semester in question.
