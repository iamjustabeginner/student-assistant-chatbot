Answer:
This section explains the application for Ritsumeikan University tuition reduction.

**Important**
The current Ritsumeikan University Tuition Reduction Scholarship for International Students will end in 2025. Tuition reduction from 2026 onwards has not yet been determined.


There is a period once per year in which we accept applications for tuition reduction. Students that were admitted in April can apply each year in early April, and students that were admitted in September can apply each year in late September.

If the time of being re-instated is different from the time of admission, those students can apply at the time of being re-instated.
