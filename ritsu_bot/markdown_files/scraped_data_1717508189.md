Question: I will not receive the language proficiency test score certificate (original) that I wish to submit with my application by the application deadline. What should I do?

Answer:
If the language proficiency test score can be checked online, please submit a screenshot of the webpage first. In this case, please submit a page that shows your name and score. Once the original arrives at a later date, please submit a copy.
