Question: Can I apply to more than one study abroad program at once?

Answer:
For the programs within the same category with the same application period and program schedule, you can apply for multiple programs or courses at the same time. In addition, there is no advantage or disadvantage to applying to one program or several in terms of selection.  
  
If you strongly desire to study abroad, we recommend that you apply for more than one program.

However, please note that students are not allowed to apply to a one semester program and long-term program simultaneously.

*For inquiries, please contact the study abroad staff at the International Center.
