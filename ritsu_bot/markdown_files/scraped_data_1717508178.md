Question: I would like to study abroad using the Leave of Absence system. Is information about this provided at the International Center?

Answer:
The International Center does not handle privately-funded study abroad using the “Leave of Absence” system.

Information about privately-funded study abroad may be provided by the Co-op Travel Center and the study abroad agencies of private companies, so please contact those groups if necessary.
