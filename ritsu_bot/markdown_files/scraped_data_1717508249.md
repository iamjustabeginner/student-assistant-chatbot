# Procedures for Changes to Personal Information (address, name, etc.)

When there is a change in your personal information, please follow the prescribed procedures as below. Please be sure to inform us if your information has changed, as there are cases where not changing it can cause significant disadvantages.

### Change of your current address or phone number

When your current address or phone number registered with the university has changed, please change it on CAMPUS WEB.

*During a leave of absence, changes cannot be made on CAMPUS WEB, so please contact the Manabi Station on your home campus (the Administrative Office, Inter-Faculty Graduate Schools for Suzaku).


### Change of your home address, parent/guardian’s name and address, emergency contact in Japan or billing name/address for tuition

When your home address, parent/guardian’s name and address, emergency contact in Japan or billing name/address for tuition registered with the university has changed, please fill in the required fields in the “Notification of Change” form, and promptly contact the Manabi Station on your home campus (the Administrative Office, Inter-Faculty Graduate Schools for Suzaku).

*When changing your parent/guardian’s name, their wet signature is required.

### Change of your name, gender or nationality

When your name (surname, name in katakana, name in alphabet), gender or nationality registered with the university has changed, please fill in the required fields in the “Notification of Change” form, and promptly contact the Manabi Station on your home campus (the Administrative Office, Inter-Faculty Graduate Schools for Suzaku).  
In case your name has been changed, after submitting the notification of change, please be sure to notify the instructor in charge of the course.

*When changing, a certification document (an extract of your family register or a certified copy of your resident register) is required. (A photocopy of the certification document is not acceptable.)

The attendance record of classes and certificates are prepared using the name registered with the University, and mail from the University is sent to the registered addresses.

(e.g.) The payment slip of tuition is sent to the “Tuition billing address.”

### Procedures to change your parent/guardians’ email address or workplace

If your parent/guardian’s email address or workplace has changed, please fill in the required fields in the “Family Information Change Request Form”, and submit it by emailing to the following address.
