Question: I am currently leaving from Japan, so I am concerned that my tuition payment slip may have been sent to my Japanese address. How can I get the payment slip?

Answer:
Tuition payment slips are not sent overseas from the university. However, even if you do not have the payment slip, you can check the amount you need to pay on CAMPUS WEB.

You can also check this page for information on how to pay tuition fees from overseas.  

If you have any other questions or concerns, please contact your faculty/graduate school administrative office. Contact information can be found on the school website.
