# BBP LEP(Language Exchange Program)｜Register Now for BBP LEP(Language Exchange Program)


The BBP Language Exchange Program (LEP) matches you with a Language Exchange Partner so you can learn from each other. (Free of charge)

 

How？

By registering your “Target Language” (the language you want to learn) and your “Teachable Language” (your native language or the language you speak), we will search for a matching language partner.

If one of registrants is compatible with your Target Language and Teachable Language, he/she will become your language partner and you can both learn and exchange language together.
