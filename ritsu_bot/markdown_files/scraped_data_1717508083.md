Question:  How do I apply for scholarships? (updated 2024/9/30) 

Answer:
Scholarship and Tuition Reduction applications are to be made via separate online application forms.

This page describes the Application for scholarships administered by the university and scholarships which require a recommendation directly from the university to the scholarship foundation in order for the student to become a potential candidate. For the Tuition Reduction application, please refer to the [Tuition Reduction Guidelines].

There is a period once per year in which we accept applications for university-recommended scholarships. Students that were admitted in April can apply each year in early April, and students that were admitted in September can apply each year in late September.

If the time of being re-instated is different from the time of admission, those students can apply at the time of being re-instated.

The flow from scholarship application to scholarship receipt is as follows.
