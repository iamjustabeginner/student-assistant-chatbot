# Readmission

**Requirements for Readmission**

If a student who has withdrawn from the University or was removed from the student registry applies for readmission within two years from the day following the last day of their final semester, the student may be permitted to return to the University subject to approval via a screening process. However, students who were removed from the student registry as a result of their enrollment period exceeding the enrollment period limit or students who were expelled for disciplinary reasons are not eligible to apply for readmission.

* The readmission system is not intended to ensure that students who have withdrawn from the University or have been removed from the student registry can study at the University again.
