Question: I want to continue job hunting in Japan after graduation. Is it possible to stay in Japan with a “Student” status of residence? (Updated 2024.08.30) 

Answer:
**“Designated Activities” status of residence**
Because “Student” statuses of residence lose their validity upon graduation or completion of studies, in order for international students who were studying at Ritsumeikan University to continue to stay in Japan, it is necessary to change their status of residence.

As indicated on the Immigration Services Agency’s website below, for those students who have been searching for a job but their employer is not decided by graduation, and wish to continue job hunting after graduation, it is possible to change to a “Designated Activities” status of residence (valid for 6 months) as long as certain requirements are met. 

**Letter of recommendation**
- In order to apply to change to a “Designated Activities” status of residence at the Immigration Bureau, a letter of recommendation from Ritsumeikan University is required.
- Ritsumeikan University holds application periods twice per year for the issuance of these letters of recommendation. International students from whom the International Center receives an application will undergo a evaluation of their studies, lifestyle condition, job hunting activities up to the time of application, motivation for the field/industry of interest, and ability to pay expenses, etc. A letter of recommendation will be issued to those students for whom it is deemed appropriate. For the screening, applicants will complete an online form, after which the International Center will conduct a document review.
- This status is only for **degree-seeking students** who will graduate from Ritsumeikan University. Non-Degree students, auditing students, exchange students, and research students cannot apply for this status.
