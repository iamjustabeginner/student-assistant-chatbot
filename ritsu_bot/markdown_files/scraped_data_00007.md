The Ritsumeikan Charter 

Ritsumeikan traces its roots to Prince Saionjiʼs private academy of the same name, established in 1869. It was officially founded in 1900 by his protégé, Kojuro Nakagawa, as the Kyoto Hosei Gakko (Kyoto School of Law and Politics), later to take on the name "Ritsumeikan." The name is derived from a passage in the Jinxin chapter of the Discourses of Mencius, and means "a place to establish one's destiny through cultivating one's mind. 

"Ritsumeikanʼs  founding  ideals  are  "freedom  and  innovation"  and  reflecting  upon  its  wartime  experience,  it committed itself to a core educational philosophy of "peace and democracy" after World War II. 

Ritsumeikan has faced the challenges of the times by pursuing an independent path to rise above adversity and has become the comprehensive private educational institution that it is today through extensive cooperation and support from both within and outside Japan.  

Ritsumeikan, as a Japanese institution located in the Asia Pacific region, is committed to sincerely reflecting upon history and to building an institution where many cultures coexist in the spirit of international mutual understanding. 

Ritsumeikan will build relationships of trust, through research and education, as well as sports and cultural activities, and establish its roots in the local community, to create an academic institution open to international society. 

Ritsumeikan will strive to strengthen links with society and promote its institutional development by fully utilizing the characteristics of a private academic institution, the participation of its faculty, staff and students, and the support of alumni and parents, while respecting the principles of autonomy, democracy, transparency, non-violence and justice.  

Ritsumeikan will pursue the creation of universal values based on academic freedom and search for solutions to the pressing issues facing humankind, with its educational endeavors based on its founding spirit and educational ideals, bearing in mind “to believe in the future, to live for the future.”  

Ritsumeikan will foster learning and the development of individual talents in order to nurture just and ethical global citizens. 

Ritsumeikan, as an institute of education and research, pledges to promote peace, democracy and sustainable development in Japan and throughout the world, in keeping with the spirit of this Charter.

The Ritsumeikan University Postgraduate Educational Mission and Vision 

The Graduate Schoolsʼ aim is to nurture students who will take the initiative backed by a profound knowledge and keen intelligence as they identify and resolve problems that stand in the way of human and social development. The Graduate Schools are committed to, in the words of the great Ritsumeikan postwar chancellor Hiroshi Suekawa, encourage their students to “believe in the future, live for the future.” 

Given this mission and these core values, graduates of the Graduate Schools are expected to demonstrate the following four key skills: 

1) Exercise autonomy of thought and action, applying the high ethical standards required of scholars and professionals while giving concrete substance to core ethical values of Peace and Democracy;

4. Curriculum Policy

The Curriculum Policy provides the basic guidelines on what kinds of educational programs to establish and educational content/methods to implement, and how to evaluate learning outcomes in order to accomplish the diploma policy.

The curriculum of the College of Information Science and Engineering is designed to cultivate human resources with broad foundational knowledge in information science, advanced expertise and creativity in highly specialized fields, and the capacity to play active roles internationally. The College is composed of one Department and seven Courses, with students extending their studies by reference to common basic knowledge in order to acquire a balance between broad fundamental knowledge relevant across different specialized fields and high-level expertise in their own field, as required to sustain the greatly expanded discipline of information science into the future. The six Courses offered in a Japanese-language medium (System Architect, Security and Networks, Frontier Social Design, Physical Computing, Audio and Visual Media Technology, Artificial and Natural Intelligence) each provide detailed coverage of learning in their respective fields, which have grown deep and diverse in content. In addition, there is an Information Systems Science and Engineering Course offered in an English-language medium, in which eveny student studies specialized content across a variety of information-related fields, with emphasis placed on the development of internationally-capable human resources.

In the spring semester of their first year of study, students learn content common across the discipline of information science, while also deepening their understanding of individual fields of research within the discipline. They begin their specialized studies from the fall semester of first year, when they are each assigned to his or her own Course. In their assigned Courses students receive specialized education from expert faculty members in the applicable field, while also undertaking studies in common fields of information science essential for all people working with information, and related fields offering connections with other Courses. In order to promote the acquisition of solid professional capabilities and communicative proficiencies, the College operates a systematic course progression system that specifies conditions for progression to the next level of study and eligibility to undertake graduation research subjects.

In order to achieve the College’s educational objective through systematic study and educational practice, individual subjects are classified into three types—Foreign Language, Liberal Arts Education, and Major Education—and Major Education subjects further into Major Foundation, Major Common, Major Specific, and Global Career Development. Foreign Language, Liberal Arts Education, and Global Career Development subjects are designed to equip students with the communicative proficiencies needed to be active internationally. Major Foundation, Major Common, and Major Specific subjects develop high-level specialist abilities. The purpose of each subject category is outlined below.

1) **Foreign Language Subjects**

   Students study English exclusively, raising their practical proficiency in academic English centered on the four key skills of Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. Some English language subjects are also offered in order to develop proficiency in professional communication.

2) **Liberal Arts Subjects**

   The aim of General Education is to furnish broad-based knowledge and a solid outlook  on the world, thereby enabling students to develop intelligence, wisdom, and value outlooks  that will guide them through life. A diverse range of subjects are offered that provide understanding of a world made up of the natural environment and human society and help students expand their studies in specialized fields. Areas covered include science, nature, work, social service, sports, society, culture, and study abroad. General Education also cultivates the value outlooks necessary for broad-based reflection on the knowledge systems and values of Major Education.

3) **Major Education**

   Major subjects are divided into four groups in order to enable systematic study of the broad range of subjects that are now covered in field of information science. The Major Foundation category comprises subjects in mathematics and natural sciences which are important in order to cultivate the fundamental capabilities necessary to study more advanced major subjects in information science. There is also a careful selection of subjects in applied mathematics, especially essential in order for students to tackle specialized subjects in information-related areas. Common material that all people working in those areas should master is covered in the Major Common subject group. Information subjects, which form part of this group, provide a careful selection of important foundational material for all areas of information science. Major Specialized subjects build on the foundations provided by Major Foundation and Major Common subjects, covering material specific to each Course. The distinctive subjects in the Major Specialized group strongly reflect the specialization of the Course under which they are offered. Classes are taught not only in a lecture format, but also through practice-based studies through laboratory work, seminars, and graduation research, enabling students to develop a more profound understanding of the specialized field of their respective Courses. Each Course also offers programming-related subjects, and laboratory/seminar-style small-group subjects are also offered in each semester without fail. In the Global Career Development group, multiple subjects are offered for different purposes and taken by students in line with their career planning. The aim of these subjects is to respond to demands for diverse learning as well as to elevate career consciousness.

5. Achievement Objectives by Year Level

5. Systematic Course Progression!

In order to achieve its human resource development aims, the College of Information Science and Engineering has a curriculum designed to enable students to study systematically across all four years of enrollment. Known as Systematic Course Progression.

1. **Course Selection**  At the end of the spring semester of your first year (1st semester), you will select what **(Course Change)** Course to study in from second semester. This is to enable you to study the specialized content of your selected Course after having developed a solid foundation of essential knowledge across all areas of information science in spring semester. The approximate schedule for Course selection is shown below.

Date: Course Selection Process
Around June: Information session on application method and dates
Mid July: Web applications open (until early August)
Late September: Course selection results released

Students are placed in Courses basically in line with their own wishes, but in Courses which have an excess of applicants, placements are made on the basis of grades (GPA) in spring semester (1st semester). Course placements for students with low credit records (10 or less credits completed) are made separately from other students.

Students enrolled through a global entrance examination stream are automatically assigned to the Information Systems Science and Engineering Course. They cannot request placement in a Japanese-medium Course. Students who were not enrolled through a global entrance examination stream may in some cases be placed in the Information Systems Science and Engineering Course on request and following an interview with faculty members (however, this is limited to those eligible to take the foreign language subjects Professional Communication 301 and Academic Literacy 302 in fall semester of their first year [2nd semester]). Liberal Arts subjects and subjects offered in 1st semester that were taken in a Japanese medium may be deemed as English-medium subjects if there is an appropriate equivalent offered in English.

When selecting your preferred Course, you are encouraged to participate actively in events such as Course showcases and open research labs, browse the website regularly, talk with instructors and senior students, and find other ways to gather your own information.

**Changing Courses**

In principle, it is not possible to change to a Course other than the one you originally selected. However, the Dean may approve a change if considered necessary for educational reasons. Course changes are only possible when entering third year. It is not possible to change from the Information Systems Science and Engineering Course to a Course offered in a Japanese medium, or vice versa.

Eligibility for Course change is restricted as follows:!

・Students must in principle have earned at least 80 credits with a GPA of at least 4.0. ・A decision will be only made following an interview with faculty members.

5.2 **Advancement System** As well as providing curriculum models for each Course to enable students to learn  systematically, there is a system for checking students’ credit records and certain stages  and providing advice as necessary. This system enables students to develop fundamental academic skills in their first two years of study before going on to deepen their specialized knowledge later. The prerequisite for advancement to third year is shown below.

Overall number of credits earned (counting toward graduation requirements): 50 credits

* If you fail to satisfy this prerequisite at the end of your second year, you will not be permitted to advance to third year and will be re-enrolled as a second year student.
* In some subjects, credits are not finalized until April of the following year and are thus awarded retrospectively. However, in such cases it is still not possible retrospectively to alter the outcome of the decision regarding advancement to third year.
5.3 **Allocation to Research Labs and Graduation Research 1**  In the spring semester of their third year of study, students are assigned to research labs, and must take the subject Graduation Research 1. However, if on the basis of grades obtained in spring semester a student has no prospect of being able to take Graduation Research 2 or 3 in the following year, the student may withdraw from Graduation Research 1 following consultation with the faculty member in charge of their graduation research. Even in such cases of withdrawal, the student will remain affiliated with their research lab and will take Graduation Research in the fall semester of the following year. The schedule for research lab allocations will be announced around the beginning of June.
   1. Students who had changes in their student registry status or who have repeated a student year during their enrollment year may be eligible for research lab allocations in spring semester of their second year. Details will be announced to applicable students.
5.4 **Eligibility to take Graduation Research 2/3**  To be eligible to take Graduation Research 2 and Graduation Research 3 in their fourth year, you must satisfy the following conditions.

6. Small-Group Education
One feature of Ritsumeikan University’s educational approach is small-group education, which is pursued from the standpoints of “activation of self-directed, collective learning,” “formation of disciplinary outlooks and establishment of learning styles,” and “cultivation of autonomous capabilities.” Major subjects in the College of Science and Engineering include “small-group subjects” operated in classes of 35–40 students. These subjects vary from Course to Course, but at least one subject is offered in each semester.

In the spring semester of students’ first year of study, small-group subjects play an important introductory role in equipping students with information literacy and communicative skills. From the fall semester of first year through the spring semester of third year, the small-group subjects offered in each Course include laboratory work and seminars. The Graduation Research 1–3 subjects, offered from fall semester of third year through fall semester of fourth year, are also nominated as small-group subjects and viewed as the culmination of the small-group education system.

Explanation and debates on the content of the university bulletin Ritsumeikan Style are also conducted in small-group classes. Furthermore, events and discussions held by each class contribute to the goals of “activation of self-directed, collective learning” and “cultivation of autonomous capabilities.” In this way, classes in small-group subjects build the foundations for learning at university, and are one of the basic components of university student life. By engaging actively in class activities, you can make your studies from now on more rewarding. Support is also provided by senior students (Oriters) in activities such as welcome events for newly-enrolling students.




7. Taking Classes in Other Colleges

There is a system that enables students to take major subjects offered in Colleges of  Ritsumeikan University other than the one in which they are enrolled, as a means to  maximize the benefits of studying at a comprehensive university and to cater for the  diverse interests of students. However, all credits earned in subjects offered by other Colleges are deemed “free electives” and do not count toward the credit requirements for graduation.

The subjects available in this system are only those major subjects offered in other Colleges that the College of Information Science and Engineering permits its students to take (you cannot simply take any major subject offered in another College).

Number of credits registerable: Maximum total of 20 credits including those already earned in subjects offered by other Colleges.
Inclusion in credit registration limits: Included when calculating maximum credits that can be registered per semester.
Credit category: Credit granted as free electives; not counted toward credit requirements for graduation
Eligibility: Students in third year and above


**Points to note:**

- Before registering, please check the list of subjects offered in other Colleges permitted for registration, and the class schedule and/or syllabus of the applicable College.
- Registration is only permitted at the start of the academic year (lottery and regular registration).
8. Early Registration of Graduate School Subjects

The system of early registration of graduate school subjects enables undergraduate students in their fourth year to take subjects offered at graduate school level in advance. In the event that the student is admitted to the applicable graduate school after graduation, the credits earned in this system may, on application, be counted as credits already earned for the purposes of completing the graduate degree.

For more details, please consult the application guidelines for early registration of graduate subjects in the applicable academic year.

1. Foreign Language Subjects

**Academic English Subjects for the ISSE Course**

During the first three semesters, students in the ISSE course must obtain 10 credits of the compulsory Academic English subjects in the following three categories.
English 109 and English 110 (1 credit each)
Professional Communication (PC) 301, 303 (2 credits each),
Academic Literacy (AL) 302, 304 (2 credits each)

English 109 and English 110 focus on English for General Academic Purposes. The 300s (PC 301, PC 303, AL 302 and AL 304) are designed to develop functionality in English in more specialized academic and research contexts.

Two subjects are offered in each semester, as is shown in the following table.

|1st Semester|2nd Semester|3rd Semester|
|English 109|PC 301|PC 303|
|English 110|AL 302|AL 304|

Note that there are following prerequisites for taking the 300s.

- PC 301 & AL 302: passing grades in English 109 or English 110 (or 600+ in TOEIC and its equivalent)
- PC 303: passing grades in PC 301
- AL 304: passing grades in AL 302

If students should receive the failing grade in any of the mandatory subjects, they must re-take the failed subject(s) in the following semester, for up to 2 credits.

As an illustrative scenario: Suppose a student should fail in both PC 301 and AL 302 in the second semester. In the third semester, s/he must re-take PC 301 before taking PC 303 and AL 304, and only if this student is successful in obtaining the credits of PC 301, s/he can be enrolled in PC 303 and re-take AL 302 in the fourth semester. However, s/ he will have to wait until the fifth semester to complete the 10 credits by successfully obtaining 2 credits of AL 304.

In addition to these mandatory subjects, students can develop their English language proficiency necessary in their specialized fields by taking one, or both, of the two optional subjects, i.e., Presentation Plus (P+) 401 and Writing for Publication (WP) 402. As the titles of these optional courses indicate, their foci are specific: P+ 401 focuses on presentation and communication skills called for in academic or specialized conferences or meetings; WP 402 develops skills for writing research papers. Students must complete PC 303 to be enrolled in P+ 401, and AL304 to be in WP 402.

2. Liberal Arts Subjects (for newly enrolled students in AY 2021)

College of Information Science and Engineering Academic Handbook 2021 —AY2021 Enrollment—　17

1. **Philosophy and Goals of Ritsumeikan University’s Liberal Arts Education**

Liberal arts education serves as the foundation for the growth of each student during their campus life. In each undergraduate college, students deepen their knowledge through specialized education. The aim of Liberal Arts is for students to look at knowledge as a  whole from a wide range of fields, and broaden their perspectives. Liberal arts education  also strives to enable students to acquire intelligence and wisdom and develop a set of  values that will guide them throughout their life. Students should deepen their learning in order to grasp social issues as if they were their own, acquire an outlook that can put their specialized knowledge in to perspective, and grow into a global citizen who can live in cooperation with others.

Based on this philosophy, three goals have been set.!
College of Information Science and Engineering Academic Handbook 2021 —AY2021 Enrollment—　17

**Goals of Liberal Arts Education**

[Goal I] Knowledge/ Understanding: To enable students to acquire the ability to put their own expertise into perspective and examine it through a system of knowledge and methodology different from the specialized education provided in each college.
[Goal II] Thinking/ Judgement/ Consciousness: To enable students to cultivate the intelligence, wisdom, set of values, and ways of thinking that will guide them throughout their life by acquiring a well-rounded education and deep insight.
[Goal III] Attitude/ Behavior: To cultivate the skills needed to shape modern society and enable students to acquire the ability to learn autonomously given the need to work with people with a variety of values.
