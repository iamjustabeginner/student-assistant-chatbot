# Establishment of Smoking Cessation Support Areas



Effective Friday, April 5, 2024, Smoking Cessation Support Areas are available in the locations shown below on Ritsumeikan University’s Kinugasa Campus, Biwako-Kusatsu Campus (BKC), and Osaka Ibaraki Campus. These areas constitute Designated Smoking Areas under the amended Health Promotion Act.

 

Since the temporary closure of the Smoking Cessation Support Areas on the three campuses in 2021 as part of the COVID-19 containment measures, there had been no areas designated for smoking within Ritsumeikan University campuses. Effective Friday, April 5, 2024, smoking is once again permitted, only in the Smoking Cessation Support Areas.

 

However, this definitely does not mean that the University promotes smoking on campus. Since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, many local residents have contacted us with complaints about young people, assumed to be Ritsumeikan University students, causing a nuisance by smoking in the campus vicinity. On our campuses themselves there has been a rapid increase in unauthorized smoking and littering of cigarette butts, which may lead to fires. The decision to reestablish the Smoking Cessation Support Areas was unavoidable in order to mitigate the serious impact on local residents, the risk of fire on campus, and the adverse health effects of unwanted passive smoking.

 

Smoking not only harms the health of smokers, but also the health of non-smokers affected by passive smoking. In light of the fact that many smokers develop their smoking habits as university students, Ritsumeikan is committed to continuing its efforts to “prevent non-smokers from taking up smoking while at university.”

 

Under the amended Health Promotion Act, universities are Type 1 Facilities: smoking on the premises is prohibited in principle, and smoking anywhere other than in Designated Smoking Areas (Smoking Cessation Support Areas) is unlawful. The University will continue to have zero tolerance for unlawful smoking outside the Smoking Cessation Support Areas, littering of cigarette butts, and nuisance smoking in the vicinity of the campus. We will be strengthening our patrols by university staff members both within and around the campus, and anybody found to be smoking unlawfully on campus will be dealt with strictly.

 

We urge all students who are smokers to consider once more how your smoking may be impacting those around you, how you may be perceived by those around you, and what impact smoking has on you personally. If you would like help to quit smoking, please visit the Medical Service Center on your campus.
