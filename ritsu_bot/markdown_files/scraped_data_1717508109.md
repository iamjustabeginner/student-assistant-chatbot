## **Section Based Questions  
＜Basic Information＞ **

**・There is no faculty option in the SKP application form that is close to my major at my home university. I would like to take courses related to my major, but is it possible to select courses outside the faculty I am affiliated with?  
** It is possible to take courses offered by faculties other than the one you have chosen as your faculty, as long as they are listed on the course list handed to SKP students. (Courses that require specialized knowledge may not be available.)  
Please note that SKP students can select courses only from the course lists for each track/campus distributed to them at the start of the course registration period. Students will not be able to choose from among all of the courses for regular students offered in English.  
  
**A track other than the one I want to apply for is listed in the Basic Information section. What should I do?**
=
For exchange students from Partner Universities: Please contact your home university Study abroad coordinator and consult with them. If your track will be changed, have your coordinator to submit a new nomination form, It is not possible to use the email address which is already registered, so inform your coordinator a different e-mail address of yours.
For self-sponsored students: Please use a different email address than the one you are already registered with and submit a new application form.

  
**Is it possible for SKP students to take courses at campuses other than which they are registered at? Or is it required that they take all their courses at one of them?**

Students can take courses from other campuses, however, please be reminded of the following.  
Intensive Japanese Learning （IJL） track students:  
IJL track students will take a Japanese placement test prior to their arrival and will receive a prefixed timetable according to their class level. They may not be able to take additional courses if the courses conflict with their Japanese timetable.  
In addition, for courses offered in English, RCE track students have the first priority to register for these courses. The IJL track is an Intensive Japanese Learning track and requires a lot of review as well as preparing for lessons. so, as a general rule, IJL students may register for a maximum of two (2) English courses.

Regular Courses in English （RCE ）track/Regular Courses in Japanese （RCJ） track students:  
Please note that in general, students who are registered at the campus will receive the first priority to register for courses offered at that campus.

Notes:  
For courses that have limited capacity, if the applicants exceed the capacity limit, a lottery will be held. Students may not be able to take their preferred courses. Students should be mindful that it takes about 1 hour and a half one way to commute by public transportation between each campus.
