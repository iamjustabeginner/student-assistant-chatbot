#### Trouble

#### Consultation on harassment

The University works on the prevention of any act of harassment by establishing Ritsumeikan University's Harassment Prevention Regulations and Harassment Prevention Guidelines.

We have advisers for you at various locations on every campus to help complainants of harassment. Consultation in English is available.  
Your privacy is always protected, so if you feel you are being harassed, please feel free to contact the advisers.  
They provide compassionate support so that your problem will be fixed.  
If you witness or know of someone around you who is being harassed, please encourage them to seek appropriate assistance from harassment advisers.
