The city has served as the heart of culture in Japan for many years and it is now considered one of the most well known and inviting international cities in the world, welcoming more than ten million foreign tourists per year. Not only is the city home to 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites including Nijo Castle, there are also more than 2,000 shrines and temples in Kyoto. Kyoto can also be enjoyed during each of the four seasons, with picturesque pink cherry blossoms followed by lush green leaves in spring, local cuisine served on decks known as “Kawa-doko” above the river in summer, deep red leaves in autumn and snowscape in winter. While everything a university student could need is available in Kyoto, when you are ready for a change of scenery, Kobe and Osaka are both located within a 60-minute train ride.
