Answer:
As indicated in the following Immigration Services Agency page, those who wish to continue to reside in Japan for the purpose of awaiting entrance to an institution of higher education, for the period after graduating from a Japanese university until entering a Japanese graduate school, may be able to apply to change to a "Designated Activities" status of residence.
