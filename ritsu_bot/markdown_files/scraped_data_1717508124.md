Question: When will we find out the results for tuition reduction? 

Answer:
For the Fall semester of 2022, the results will be announced in mid-Nov. Beginning with the 2022 academic year, we will be able to announce the results of tuition fee reductions to students prior to the tuition payment deadline.

However, undergraduate students have their first year's tuition reduction decided based on their performance on the entrance examination before entering the university.
