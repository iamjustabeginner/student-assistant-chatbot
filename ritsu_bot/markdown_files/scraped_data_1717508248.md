# Grade Notification and Grade Confirmation System

### Grades Notification

Grades are released on the designated grade notification date for each course offering period. Students can find their grades on CAMPUS WEB “Course Registration and Grade Status” page. Make sure to verify the credits you have earned and plan your course registration for the upcoming semester.

A grade report for each semester will be made available online for students’ legal guardians, guardians or individuals who take on that roll (parents). The grade report for spring semester will be accessible in early October, while the grade reports for fall semester will be available in late March (only available for undergraduate students).
