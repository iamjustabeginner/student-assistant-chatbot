# General Education Courses Conducted in a Foreign Language

International Liberal Arts Subjects (Group B Liberal Arts Courses) intend to lay the foundations for cultivating mutual intercultural understanding, which is vital in an increasingly globalized world.Courses use a foreign language, and some classes are conducted in a lecture style while other classes are in small groups with emphasis placed on active discussion.

Classes are made up of students from various colleges, grade years, countries and global regions, and courses are divided into various stages so that students can choose the appropriate ones based on their language abilities, experience of international interaction, and study-abroad plans.

Thus, even students who doubt their abilities can easily join.
