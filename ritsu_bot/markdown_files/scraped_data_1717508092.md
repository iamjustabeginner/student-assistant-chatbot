Question: At what times do I have to submit a copy of my Residence Card to the university?

Answer:

The university, as an institution accepting international students, must be aware of the studies/research that students are conducting and their status of residence, and as necessary must inform the Immigration Services Agency and MEXT (the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) of this information.

It is vital that the university stay aware of each student's status of residence, so that we are able to smoothly support them in the event that they get involved in trouble.

When you extend or change your status of residence, take a leave of absence, or when the university requests it, please submit your Residence Card as soon as possible.

Please submit it at [International Center > Submit a request] at the International Center Online Support Desk website.
