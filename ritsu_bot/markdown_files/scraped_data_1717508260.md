# Transferring

Transferring is a system where students relocate from their current college or department at Ritsumeikan to a different Ritsumeikan college or department.

*For information regarding changing your major, course, or program, please read the “Academic Handbook (for your college).”
  

**Requirements for Transfer**

Students are only eligible to transfer in their second or third year if they meet the requirements at the completion of their first and/or second year of enrollment and transfers may be approved upon screening by the administrative office of the student’s college as well as the college the student wishes to transfer to. In addition, transferring is not permitted in the middle of the academic year or during a semester different from the student’s admission semester (e.g., April enrollment: fall semester transfer, September enrollment: spring semester transfer).

  

For application requirements and other information, refer to the transfer guide issued around December each year (around June for students who enrolled in September) available at the administrative office of the college the student is enrolled in (OIC: Manabi Station). Colleges/departments which are accepting students from other colleges vary from year to year.

**[Application requirements]**

Those who, at the end of their first year, have completed all foreign language courses required of first-year students and expect to earn at least 30 credits that count toward their graduation requirement.
