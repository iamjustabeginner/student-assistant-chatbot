**Club Activities**
Ritsumeikan University has a long tradition of sport and other extracurricular activities for both native Japanese and international students alike. With over 450 teams, clubs, and circles, students are bound to find extra curricular activities that will not only help round out their academic experience at Ritsumeikan University, but also allow for them to make connections with other students while enjoying an old or new hobby.

If you are interested in joining a specific club or circle, or just want to know what kinds are available, please visit the International Center at your campus.

Please understand however that Japanese university student clubs can be very demanding as far as commitment and time are concerned. It would therefore be wise to evaluate your objectives carefully before deciding to officially become a member of a club or circle.

Some examples of clubs and circles available to Ritsumeikan students can be seen below.

### Aikido (Weaponless self-defense)
You may think that Aikido is a kind of magical martial art to make an attack by using life energy ("ki" in Japanese), however, it is often used for self-defense. As there is no so-called victory or defeat, nor convention, beginners are able to train and progress at one's own pace.
