Question: I do not have a passport yet. Can I still apply for a study abroad program?

Answer:
You can apply even if you do not have a passport at the time of application to a study abroad program. However, you may need a passport as soon as your participation in the program is decided for visa acquisition purposes, etc.  
  
Therefore, please apply for a passport while preparing your study abroad program application without waiting for program application results.
