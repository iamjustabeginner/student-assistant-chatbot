4. Curriculum Policy

The Curriculum Policy provides the basic guidelines on what kinds of educational programs to establish and educational content/methods to implement, and how to evaluate learning outcomes in order to accomplish the diploma policy.

The curriculum of the College of Information Science and Engineering is designed to cultivate human resources with broad foundational knowledge in information science, advanced expertise and creativity in highly specialized fields, and the capacity to play active roles internationally. The College is composed of one Department and seven Courses, with students extending their studies by reference to common basic knowledge in order to acquire a balance between broad fundamental knowledge relevant across different specialized fields and high-level expertise in their own field, as required to sustain the greatly expanded discipline of information science into the future. The six Courses offered in a Japanese-language medium (System Architect, Security and Networks, Frontier Social Design, Physical Computing, Audio and Visual Media Technology, Artificial and Natural Intelligence) each provide detailed coverage of learning in their respective fields, which have grown deep and diverse in content. In addition, there is an Information Systems Science and Engineering Course offered in an English-language medium, in which eveny student studies specialized content across a variety of information-related fields, with emphasis placed on the development of internationally-capable human resources.

In the spring semester of their first year of study, students learn content common across the discipline of information science, while also deepening their understanding of individual fields of research within the discipline. They begin their specialized studies from the fall semester of first year, when they are each assigned to his or her own Course. In their assigned Courses students receive specialized education from expert faculty members in the applicable field, while also undertaking studies in common fields of information science essential for all people working with information, and related fields offering connections with other Courses. In order to promote the acquisition of solid professional capabilities and communicative proficiencies, the College operates a systematic course progression system that specifies conditions for progression to the next level of study and eligibility to undertake graduation research subjects.

In order to achieve the College’s educational objective through systematic study and educational practice, individual subjects are classified into three types—Foreign Language, Liberal Arts Education, and Major Education—and Major Education subjects further into Major Foundation, Major Common, Major Specific, and Global Career Development. Foreign Language, Liberal Arts Education, and Global Career Development subjects are designed to equip students with the communicative proficiencies needed to be active internationally. Major Foundation, Major Common, and Major Specific subjects develop high-level specialist abilities. The purpose of each subject category is outlined below.

1) **Foreign Language Subjects**

   Students study English exclusively, raising their practical proficiency in academic English centered on the four key skills of Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. Some English language subjects are also offered in order to develop proficiency in professional communication.

2) **Liberal Arts Subjects**

   The aim of General Education is to furnish broad-based knowledge and a solid outlook  on the world, thereby enabling students to develop intelligence, wisdom, and value outlooks  that will guide them through life. A diverse range of subjects are offered that provide understanding of a world made up of the natural environment and human society and help students expand their studies in specialized fields. Areas covered include science, nature, work, social service, sports, society, culture, and study abroad. General Education also cultivates the value outlooks necessary for broad-based reflection on the knowledge systems and values of Major Education.

3) **Major Education**

   Major subjects are divided into four groups in order to enable systematic study of the broad range of subjects that are now covered in field of information science. The Major Foundation category comprises subjects in mathematics and natural sciences which are important in order to cultivate the fundamental capabilities necessary to study more advanced major subjects in information science. There is also a careful selection of subjects in applied mathematics, especially essential in order for students to tackle specialized subjects in information-related areas. Common material that all people working in those areas should master is covered in the Major Common subject group. Information subjects, which form part of this group, provide a careful selection of important foundational material for all areas of information science. Major Specialized subjects build on the foundations provided by Major Foundation and Major Common subjects, covering material specific to each Course. The distinctive subjects in the Major Specialized group strongly reflect the specialization of the Course under which they are offered. Classes are taught not only in a lecture format, but also through practice-based studies through laboratory work, seminars, and graduation research, enabling students to develop a more profound understanding of the specialized field of their respective Courses. Each Course also offers programming-related subjects, and laboratory/seminar-style small-group subjects are also offered in each semester without fail. In the Global Career Development group, multiple subjects are offered for different purposes and taken by students in line with their career planning. The aim of these subjects is to respond to demands for diverse learning as well as to elevate career consciousness.

5. Achievement Objectives by Year Level

**Spring semester of first year (1st semester)**

The aim here is to acquire foundational abilities in the natural sciences, mathematics, languages, etc., along with the proper ethical sense of an information technologist and foundational knowledge common to all areas of information science.

5. Systematic Course Progression!

In order to achieve its human resource development aims, the College of Information Science and Engineering has a curriculum designed to enable students to study systematically across all four years of enrollment. Known as Systematic Course Progression, this system is outlined in the figure below.


1. **Course Selection (Course Change)**  At the end of the spring semester of your first year (1st semester), you will select what Course to study in from second semester. This is to enable you to study the specialized content of your selected Course after having developed a solid foundation of essential knowledge across all areas of information science in spring semester. The approximate schedule for Course selection is shown below.

Date: Course Selection Process
Around June: Information session on application method and dates
Mid July: Web applications open (until early August)
Late September: Course selection results released

Students are placed in Courses basically in line with their own wishes, but in Courses which have an excess of applicants, placements are made on the basis of grades (GPA) in spring semester (1st semester). Course placements for students with low credit records (10 or less credits completed) are made separately from other students.

Students enrolled through a global entrance examination stream are automatically assigned to the Information Systems Science and Engineering Course. They cannot request placement in a Japanese-medium Course. Students who were not enrolled through a global entrance examination stream may in some cases be placed in the Information Systems Science and Engineering Course on request and following an interview with faculty members (however, this is limited to those eligible to take the foreign language subjects Professional Communication 301 and Academic Literacy 302 in fall semester of their first year [2nd semester]). Liberal Arts subjects and subjects offered in 1st semester that were taken in a Japanese medium may be deemed as English-medium subjects if there is an appropriate equivalent offered in English.

When selecting your preferred Course, you are encouraged to participate actively in events such as Course showcases and open research labs, browse the website regularly, talk with instructors and senior students, and find other ways to gather your own information.

**Changing Courses**

In principle, it is not possible to change to a Course other than the one you originally selected. However, the Dean may approve a change if considered necessary for educational reasons. Course changes are only possible when entering third year. It is not possible to change from the Information Systems Science and Engineering Course to a Course offered in a Japanese medium, or vice versa.

Eligibility for Course change is restricted as follows:

・Students must in principle have earned at least 80 credits with a GPA of at least 4.0. ・A decision will be only made following an interview with faculty members.

2. **Advancement System** As well as providing curriculum models for each Course to enable students to learn  systematically, there is a system for checking students’ credit records and certain stages  and providing advice as necessary. This system enables students to develop fundamental academic skills in their first two years of study before going on to deepen their specialized knowledge later. The prerequisite for advancement to third year is shown below.

Overall number of credits earned (counting toward graduation requirements): 50 credits


* If you fail to satisfy this prerequisite at the end of your second year, you will not be permitted to advance to third year and will be re-enrolled as a second year student.
* In some subjects, credits are not finalized until April of the following year and are thus awarded retrospectively. However, in such cases it is still not possible retrospectively to alter the outcome of the decision regarding advancement to third year.

3. **Allocation to Research Labs and Graduation Research 1**  In the spring semester of their third year of study, students are assigned to research  labs, and must take the subject Graduation Research 1. However, if on the basis of grades obtained in spring semester a student has no prospect of being able to take Graduation Research 2 or 3 in the following year, the student may withdraw from Graduation Research 1 following consultation with the faculty member in charge of their graduation research. Even in such cases of withdrawal, the student will remain affiliated with their research lab and will take Graduation Research in the fall semester of the following year. The schedule for research lab allocations will be announced around the beginning of June.
3. **Eligibility to take Graduation Research**  To be eligible to take Graduation Research 2 and Graduation Research 3 in their fourth year, you must satisfy the following conditions.


[Foreign Language Subjects]
Number of Credits: Number of Credits

[Major Subjects]
Subject Name:
Programming Practice 1, Programming Practice 2: 4 credits
Graduation Research 1: 2 credits

Overall number of credits earned (counting toward graduation requirements): 96 credits




* In some subjects, credits are not finalized until April of the following year and are thus awarded retrospectively. However, in such cases it is still not possible retrospectively to alter the outcome of the decision regarding eligibility for Graduation Research 2/3.
* If you do not satisfy these conditions you will not be eligible to take Graduation Research 2/3, but you will still progress through the year levels of the Course as normal.
* You must have completed Graduation Research 2 in order to take Graduation Research 3.

College of Information Science and Engineering Academic Handbook 2019 —AY2019 Enrollment—　11

6. Small-Group Education

One feature of Ritsumeikan University’s educational approach is small-group education, which is pursued from the standpoints of “activation of self-directed, collective learning,” “formation of disciplinary outlooks and establishment of learning styles,” and “cultivation of autonomous capabilities.” Major subjects in the College of Science and Engineering include “small-group subjects” operated in classes of 35–40 students. These subjects vary from Course to Course, but at least one subject is offered in each semester.

In the spring semester of students’ first year of study, small-group subjects play an important introductory role in equipping students with information literacy and communicative skills. From the fall semester of first year through the spring semester of third year, the small-group subjects offered in each Course include laboratory work and seminars. The Graduation Research 1–3 subjects, offered from fall semester of third year through fall semester of fourth year, are also nominated as small-group subjects and viewed as the culmination of the small-group education system.

Explanation and debates on the content of the university bulletin Ritsumeikan Style are also conducted in small-group classes. Furthermore, events and discussions held by each class contribute to the goals of “activation of self-directed, collective learning” and “cultivation of autonomous capabilities.” In this way, classes in small-group subjects build the foundations for learning at university, and are one of the basic components of university student life. By engaging actively in class activities, you can make your studies from now on more rewarding. Support is also provided by senior students (Oriters) in activities such as welcome events for newly-enrolling students.

7. Taking Classes in Other Colleges
There is a system that enables students to take major subjects offered in Colleges of Ritsumeikan University other than the one in which they are enrolled, as a means to  maximize the benefits of studying at a comprehensive university and to cater for the  diverse interests of students. However, all credits earned in subjects offered by other Colleges are deemed “free electives” and do not count toward the credit requirements for graduation.

The subjects available in this system are only those major subjects offered in other Colleges that the College of Information Science and Engineering permits its students to take (you cannot simply take any major subject offered in another College).

|Number of credits registerable|Maximum total of 20 credits including those already earned in subjects offered by other Colleges.|
| :-: | :- |
|Inclusion in credit registration limits|Included when calculating maximum credits that can be registered per semester.|
|Credit category|Credit granted as free electives; not counted toward credit requirements for graduation|
|Eligibility|Students in third year and above|

**Points to note:**

- Before registering, please check the list of subjects offered in other Colleges permitted for registration, and the class schedule and/or syllabus of the applicable College.
- Registration is only permitted at the start of the academic year (lottery and regular registration).
8. Early Registration of Graduate School Subjects

The system of early registration of graduate school subjects enables undergraduate students in their fourth year to take subjects offered at graduate school level in advance.

1. Foreign Language Subjects
**Academic English Subjects for the ISSE Course**

During the first three semesters, students in the ISSE course must obtain 10 credits of the compulsory Academic English subjects in the following three categories.

1) English 109 and English 110 (1 credit each)
1) Professional Communication (PC) 301, 303 (2 credits each),
1) Academic Literacy (AL) 302, 304 (2 credits each)

English 109 and English 110 focus on English for General Academic Purposes. The 300s (PC 301, PC 303, AL 302 and AL 304) are designed to develop functionality in English in more specialized academic and research contexts.

Two subjects are offered in each semester, as is shown in the following table.

|1st Semester|2nd Semester|3rd Semester|
| - | - | - |
|English 109 English 110|PC 301 AL 302|PC 303 AL 304|

Note that there are following prerequisites for taking the 300s.

- PC 301 & AL 302: passing grades in English 109 or English 110 (or 600+ in TOEIC and its equivalent)
- PC 303: passing grades in PC 301
- AL 304: passing grades in AL 302

If students should receive the failing grade in any of the mandatory subjects, they must re-take the failed subject(s) in the following semester, for up to 2 credits.

As an illustrative scenario: Suppose a student should fail in both PC 301 and AL 302 in the second semester. In the third semester, s/he must re-take PC 301 before taking PC 303 and AL 304, and only if this student is successful in obtaining the credits of PC 301, s/he can be enrolled in PC 303 and re-take AL 302 in the fourth semester. However, s/ he will have to wait until the fifth semester to complete the 10 credits by successfully obtaining 2 credits of AL 304.

In addition to these mandatory subjects, students can develop their English language proficiency necessary in their specialized fields by taking one, or both, of the two optional subjects, i.e., Presentation Plus (P+) 401 and Writing for Publication (WP) 402. As the titles of these optional courses indicate, their foci are specific: P+ 401 focuses on presentation and communication skills called for in academic or specialized conferences or meetings; WP 402 develops skills for writing research papers. Students must complete PC 303 to be enrolled in P+ 401, and AL304 to be in WP 402.

2. Liberal Arts Subjects!

**Philosophy for the liberal arts subjects offered in Ritsumeikan University**

Liberal arts education in Ritsumeikan University pursues the learning of knowledge not offered in the specialized education in undergraduate colleges, while placing value on the philosophy and target of the education provided in each undergraduate college. In other  words, liberal arts education aims to instruct the sense of value required for reviewing and  reconsidering the knowledge structure and values of the specialized education provided by each college from a broader perspective in addition to the specialties. It also aims to enable students to acquire the intelligence, wisdom, and sense of value that would guide them throughout their life by providing a broad education and by forming a firm outlook of the world. By acquiring such an intelligence structure together with the specialized education provided in each college, we aim to develop global citizens of the 21st century who are balanced both in mental and physical aspects.

The 20th century was one of innovation in scientific technologies and dramatic reformation in political and economic structures. Such reform is continuing, with expectations posed for major changes in this century, too. In the academic world, changes and reformation in the intelligence structure are continuing not only in the areas of the humanities and social sciences but also in the areas of the natural sciences. Developments in information sciences have rendered major impacts on society. Liberal arts education is provided for the purpose of shaping intelligence in a wide range for the learner to be able to correspond to such reformation. Modern society is reformed in a complex manner, providing variety in the sense of value. People living in such a society will need to develop abilities to discern areas characterized by various issues and for identifying problems. To achieve these purposes, Ritsumeikan University will exercise its superiority as a reputed university and will provide liberal arts education.

The subjects are mainly provided for regular students; their foreign language proficiency may be fully utilized, whereas their understanding of different cultures would be enhanced. The subjects are provided for students who aim to study abroad.


**Category of subjects on general international education**

The subjects in this category include those where the students can learn matters across the areas of humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences provided by highly specialized lecturers, and in English or in other elementary level non-Japanese languages, in exercise style or in lecture style. Among these subjects, “Theme Study” is provided for small-group classes of 20 to 35 participants where group discussions are held and presentations are made in a proactive manner, and where mutual learning between students from different colleges, grades, and cultural backgrounds is ensured. The subjects are intended to foster a wide range of intelligence and communication capabilities, and establish firm perspectives regarding humans and the world

**Category of subjects on communication between different cultures**

The subjects in this category are those where an international perspective can be fostered via communication between students from different cultural and historical backgrounds. There are subjects such as “Cross-cultural Encounters” and “Basic Communication Skills,” in which students can learn communication between different cultures and understanding of others by learning communication and the sense of value from the perspective of spoken languages; and “Advanced Seminar,” in which understanding toward different cultures will be promoted by mutual studying via group work between Japanese and international students for the themes regarding global matters and other matters that would lead to forming future careers.

**Category of subjects for studying abroad**

The subjects in this category are provided for students who aim to, or are scheduled to, study abroad for half a year or an entire year. Subjects include preparatory subjects required for studying at universities overseas. There are subjects such as “Basic Academic Skills” and “Intermediate Academic Skills,” in which students concentrate on obtaining the literacy required for studying abroad by utilizing the four techniques of “reading, listening, writing, and speaking” a language in a comprehensive manner additionally to the regular foreign language studies offered by the college; and “Intermediate Seminar,” in which students learn practical basic knowledge and academic skills by utilizing the four techniques in a comprehensive manner based on the learning gained through the former two subjects (classes may be offered for international students as well).

- The subject college, language in which the class is offered, proficiency level, and seating capacity for Group B subjects will vary according to each subject/class. Conditions for course availability and registration methods will vary depending on the subject as well.
- A number of the subjects covered by the studying-abroad program can be approved as credit for Liberal Arts Group B subjects. For details, please confirm from the brochures for each study-abroad program.


3. Major Subjects
1. **Major Foundation**  The Major Foundation group comprises subjects on numeracy and natural sciences, **Subjects** and subjects on mathematics. In particular, the mathematics subjects cover matters necessary for mathematical expression and analysis of information itself, understanding of methods of information processing, and analysis and monitoring of information systems. Major Foundation subjects are important for the cultivation of foundational knowledge required to study more advanced major subjects in the College of Information Science and Engineering. You will make use of the knowledge acquired in these subjects not only in other subjects in the major but also in your graduation research.

1. **Major Common Subjects**  The Major Common group includes subjects in information science, and global IT, which should be acquired by all people involved in information-related fields, regardless of their specific course of study. Information science subjects include those designed to develop the communication skills demanded of information technologists, and core subjects for the study of computer hardware and software. The study of information ethics, information literacy, information gathering and searching, presentation skills, and academic writing is also undertaken from first year level. Furthermore, with a view to responding to the demands of globalization, some information science subjects are offered in both Japanese and English. It is possible to take these subjects in English provided conditions such as English language proficiency requirements and class quotas are met.

The global IT subject Information Science in Action is positioned as an introductory subject strongly directed to producing human resources for international roles. The aim is to cultivate students accustomed to the English used in the information science field and comfortable in dealing with English-language texts. In Presentation Plus 401 and Writing for Publication 402, students already equipped with adequate English language proficiency develop skills for making presentations at international conferences and writing articles for publication in international academic journals.

**Points to note when registering for subjects**

Major Common subjects (information science subjects) are designated as second-year level subjects, but the recommended year level for taking these subjects varies depending on the Course you are enrolled in. You should therefore check the curriculum chart for your Course before registering.

3. **Major Specific Subjects**  Major Specific subjects are offered in the specialized areas covered by each course, and build on the foundations provided by Major Foundation and Major Common subjects. As well as reinforcing those foundations in preparation for specialized learning in the Course, these subjects impart knowledge of programming languages and methods. By taking more advanced subjects in the specialist field of their Course, students gain a deeper understanding of their field. At the same time, laboratory and seminar activities build practical capabilities for application in information technology settings in wider society. Furthermore, students in the fall semester of third year begin work on their graduation research, and complete a graduation thesis, the culmination of their four years of undergraduate study, in the fall semester of fourth year. Graduation research brings students into contact with cutting-edge information technologies and provides them with experience in identifying and analyzing research problems, proposing solutions, and evaluating those solutions.

3. **Global Career Development Subjects**  The purpose of Global Career Development subjects is to enable students to think about what it might mean for them to work in the future, and to enhance their career consciousness and pursue their studies in a self-directed, pro-active manner. There are four subject categories: the Career Development Program centered on careers education, the Global IT Program which enhances English language proficiency and instills an international outlook, the Information Qualifications Program for the acquisition of systematized skills essential to succeed as an IT technologist, and the MOT Introductory Program that connects advanced information technology with business management.

A diversity of learning needs are addressed through the provision of multiple subjects with different purposes. For example, students can listen directly to engineers and researchers invited from companies and other partners speaking on how university studies can be applied in wider society, and thereby gain opportunities to think deeply about the 

actual conditions and roles of information technology in society.
