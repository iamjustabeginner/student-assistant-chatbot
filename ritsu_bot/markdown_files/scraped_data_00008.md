**1.Things You Need to Know Before Course Registration**

- Course registration means deciding the subject to take, receive a grade from, and register for.
- You are not qualified to take the subject which you have not registered for. Even if you attend the class, submit the report and take the final examination for such subject, the results will be invalid and not be subject to be graded.
- You are required to complete the course registration during the designated registration period, taking into consideration the instructions provided in the Academic Handbook and Registration Guidebook as well as the timetable and syllabus of your college. 
- You are not eligible to retake the subject which you have acquired credits from. However, you are eligible to register for the subject that you have registered for in the past and received a grade of “F”.

**4.Course Registration Procedures**

Complete the procedures outlined in the following 3 steps in order to register for courses.  

1) **Plan for taking courses** 

Course Registration is the basis for students taking courses systematically and acquiring credits at their college. Students are required to register for courses they want to take (or have to take) during the specified period based on their college’s “Academic Handbook,” “Registration Guidebook” and “Time Schedule/Syllabus.” In addition, most classes start in the 1st week from the day on which classes begin, and consist of 15 classes as well as private study. Even during the course registration period, students must attend classes starting from the 1st week. 

When registering for courses, please read the academic handbook and syllabus carefully to make sure you are aware of the position of the course you wish to study in the curriculum, the student attainment objectives and course outline of the course, and register for courses in a planned manner. 

You can search and view the syllabus from the My Page of manaba+R (the page that appears immediately after you log in). 


“Class Format (face-to-face or media-based)”, “Course outline and Method”, “Student Attainment Objectives”, “Recommendations for Private Study”, “Grade Evaluation Method” etc., are stated in the syllabus for each course. Moreover, if your college has a curriculum map (a table showing the relationship between individual courses and the college’s educational aims) and a curriculum tree (a diagram showing the layout of courses along the pathways of learning), you can use the links to see where the relevant course is positioned in the curriculum of the college. It is important that you check these carefully when choosing courses to register for. 

\*The results of course survey for the previous year can be found in the syllabus of the previous year for the relevant 

course. 

\*You can only register for courses listed in the timetable, not for all courses listed in the syllabus. 

2) **Application to Add / Delete Course Registration** 

Confirm the type of course registration and period using this guidebook and the Schedule of Courses, log into CAMPUS WEB from manaba+R, and complete an application for course registration. 

[Type of Course Registration and Period] 

Lottery-Based Courses: Courses registered during the Lottery-Based Course Registration Period. If the number of students registered for a class exceeds capacity, the students able to take the class will be decided by lottery.

Regular  Courses: Courses registered during the Regular Registration Period.

-> Registration applications for lottery-based courses and regular courses are made through the university's online system. Please refer to "4. Logging into the Course Registration System" ~"8. Course Registration and Grade Status". Please refer to "8.4 Confirming Lottery-Based Course Selection Results" regarding the method for confirming the selection results of lottery-based courses.


Office Registered Courses: The university will register the courses. Students do not need to register courses themselves. *Cannot delete these courses.
-> Application not required


Queue-Based Selection-Based: Some courses with an enrollmentcapacity (special lectures, teacher training courses, etc.) decide which students can take classes based on special screening or on a first-come-first-served basis.
-> Please confirm “Course Registration” on the Page for students in the College of Information Science and Engineering on manaba+R and carry out the specified registration procedures for each course.


[Uptime of manaba+R and CAMPUS WEB]
manaba+R: 24 hrs.
CAMPUS WEB: 6:30 a.m. - 2:00 a.m.

3) **Confirming Registration Details** 

If there is a mistake in the application details, you may either receive an immediate error message that prevents you from registering a course or an error may be determined the following day that makes your registration application invalid. Please be sure to check that all courses you wish to register are displayed in the "Course Registration and Grade List" on the Course Registration and Grade Status screen the day after submitting your application. 



\*Check to see if there are any errors displayed in the "Course Registration Error List" on the Course Registration and Grade Status screen.  

\*Courses with an error have not been registered successfully and you will not receive a grade even if you attend classes. (Credit will not be awarded)

An “applied basics” program to acquire basic skills for applying mathematics, data science, and AI to one’s specialized field are offered as follows. 



|Subjects (Liberal Arts Subjects) |Year Level |
| - | - |
|Foundations of Data Science and AI |1st and above |

**Difference between “Overseas IT Training Program” and “Overseas Internship”** 



|Program |Contents |Student year |
|Overseas IT Training Program |Participants will be studying for expertise knowledge about IT and English language, while staying at a partner university of Ritsumeikan University. After  classes,  you  may  participate  in  various  activities  provided  by  each university and engage in self-study at the university's  facilities.

You will be able to acquire international sensibilities and fundamental skills as a member of society by working with people in a foreign country, while utilizing specialized knowledge acquired in university.** |3rd year or above |

**Highly recommended for someone like this!**

**I want to work for a famous major company in the future!** 

Most famous major companies (manufacturing industry, information technology industry, web service industry, etc) have 


expanded their business abroad and engaged in the research and development on a worldwide level. Having an experience of studying abroad can be an advantage for job hunting. 

**I want to acquire language skills and international sensibilities!** 

Your language skills can be improved with your continuous effort of studying before and after the program. However, the 

language skill is not the only skill to be acquired by studying abroad. Intercultural adaptive skills, flexibility, and self- management are also important skills to be acquired through an overseas experience. 

**I want to experience a special thing I can only do now at college!** 

There are many students who have participated in short-term study abroad programs offered in English-speaking country while they were in high school. As a college student, you may also try non-English-speaking countries (India, Vietnam, China). Feeling the energy of these rapidly growing countries will be a powerful personal experience when entering the workforce.
