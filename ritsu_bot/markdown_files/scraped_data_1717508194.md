Question: How many credits should I earn before studying abroad?


Answer:
Before applying for a study abroad program, please create a subject registration plan that takes into account your period of study abroad and consult with your collegeâ€™s administrative office (or Manabi Station for the OIC). Make sure that you plan thoroughly, including not only courses taken before studying abroad but also those to be taken after returning to Japan.

*For inquiries, please contact the study abroad staff at the International Center.
