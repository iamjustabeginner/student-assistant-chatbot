Question: Do I need a GPA to apply for a study abroad program?

Answer:
GPA requirements vary depending on the study abroad program. For details, please check the application guidelines for each program.

Even if the program does not set a GPA standard as an application requirement, it will be an evaluation item in the selection process, so please be diligent in your studies everyday.
