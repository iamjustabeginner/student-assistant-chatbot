# Study Abroad

**(1) Study abroad programs**

Students will be permitted to participate in a study abroad program offered by RU provided that the faculty council of their college approved that the student’s participation is considered to be beneficial for their education.

If a student finds a study abroad program on their own, the program may be recognized as study abroad provided that the student’s college has given its approval after considering whether participation would be beneficial for the student’s education and upon agreement with the host institution (independent study abroad). Students must consult with the administrative office of their college (OIC: Manabi Station) in advance.

**(2) Period of study abroad**

The period of study abroad is counted as part of the total period of university enrollment. The academic calendar as determined by the host institution abroad may not match up with the academic calendar at RU; however, the start date of study abroad shall be considered to be the first day of the RU semester that the study abroad is approved for and the end date of the study abroad shall be the last day of the RU semester.
