Important Procedures When Leaving Japan 

**１）Notification procedures concerning separation from your accepting organization**

If you leave the organization where you are conducting permitted activities due to graduation or a leave of absence, you must notify the Immigration Bureau within 14 days in accordance with the procedures set by the Ministry of Justice. Additional information and necessary documents can be found on the Immigration Bureau website.


In addition, notify the immigration officer at the airport that you will be returning to your home country and hand over your residence card.

**２）Notice of Moving Overseas and Returning National Health Insurance Card**

Before returning to your home country, you must submit a Notice of Moving Overseas (海外転出届) to the city hall or ward office with jurisdiction over the area in which you have been residing. Please also complete procedures to withdraw from National Health Insurance (approximately 1 week before departure). Show your airline ticket as proof of you leaving Japan and have the staff member at your local city hall or ward office confirm the situation regarding insurance fee payments up until your planned date of departure. (You will receive a statement for any unpaid fees. Please pay the fees before departure.) By completing these procedures, you can receive insurance coverage up until you leave Japan. Please bring your residence card, health insurance card, and documents pertaining to your date of departure to your city hall or ward office. Return your health insurance card according the instructions given by the staff member. If you do not return your health insurance card,
you will continue to be billed for health insurance fees, so please be sure to complete the necessary procedures before leaving Japan.

**３）Mail**

When you move, you are required to submit a notice of change of address to the post office. In addition, please tell your friends and parttime work your new contact details beforehand so that you can be reached after leaving Japan. It is not possible to have mail forwarded overseas. After submitting the notice, mail will no longer be delivered to your old address.

**４）Student ID Card**

When you graduate or withdraw from Ritsumeikan University, you will be required to return your student ID card. Your student ID card contains your student ID number and affiliated college or graduate school. This information may be required when you contact Ritsumeikan University in the future, so you should make a photocopy or take a photo of your ID card before returning it and keep the copy/photo in a safe place.

**５）Ritsumeikan University Co-op Card**

Please return your Co-op Card to the Co-op Counter on your affiliated campus before leaving Japan. The initial deposit you paid when joining the Ritsumeikan University Co-op will be refunded to you. If you have any money remaining on your card, be sure to use the remaining amount at a Co-op shop/cafeteria before completing withdrawal procedures.

**６）Other**

Be sure to cancel your cell phone contract and housing rental agreement before leaving Japan to return to your home country. If you leave Japan without canceling such contracts and fail to make payments, you may be contacted in your home country. Ritsumeikan University will take no responsibility regarding such matters. Similarly, be sure to return any rental DVDs or books borrowed from libraries.
