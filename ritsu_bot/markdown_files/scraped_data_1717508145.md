Question: If I participate in a study abroad program for longer than one semester - does Ritsumeikan University treat this as “Leave of Absence”? Also will my graduation date be delayed?

Answer:
If you will participate in a study abroad program for a period of one semester or more, your enrollment status during this period will be “studying abroad” and included in the period of study required for graduation.

In addition, credits earned at a host institution through the study abroad program can be transferred to RU credit system if students apply for Credit Transfer at their college office. Of course, your situation may differ depending on your study plan and course situation (in regards to obtained credits), but in principle, graduation is possible within the system’s standard term for completion.
