Question: After paying my tuition, the results of the tuition reduction applications were released and I found out that I overpaid. Can I be refunded?

Answer:
If you found out that you overpaid on tuition with the announcement of results of the tuition reduction applications, you will be refunded or have the difference subtracted from your next semester's payment. The timing for refunds varies depending on the status of tuition payment, but a notification of the refund procedure will be delivered at the latest during May of the year after the student applied for the tuition reduction.
