# 【Kyoto Intercollegiate Festa】The 1st International Students Meetup

Hello. This is the office of student affairs.

This information is based on a request from Kyoto Intercollegiate Festa.

【Kyoto Intercollegiate Festa】The 1st International Students Meetup


The Kyoto Intercollegiate Festa is a student organization that brings together students in Kyoto to promote our city and its charms.

 

At the first social event, we will play physical exercise-related games.

All the games will be easy and fun.

If you are still learning Japanese, that's OK too.

We are looking forward to your participation!
