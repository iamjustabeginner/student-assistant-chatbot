## Student Year Progression

### All Colleges except College of Information Science and Engineering and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences

Students usually become first-year students upon enrollment, and their academic year progresses in one-year units regardless of the number of credits they have earned.  
If a student who is enrolled in the College of Information Science and Engineering fails to earn enough credits at the end of the second year, the student cannot proceed to the next year. In this case, the student has to repeat the year to earn the credit. Please note that students are not allowed to enroll in the University beyond their eighth year.

### Graduate Schools

Upon admission, new entrants to the graduate school will be in Year One. Each year, the student’s year level is automatically incremented by one, regardless of the number of credits they have earned.  
If a student who is enrolled in Master’s program, which standard period of study is two years, fails to earn the required number of credits needed to complete the program by the end of Year Two, the student’s year level proceeds up until Year Four.
