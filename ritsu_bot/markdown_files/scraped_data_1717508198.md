Question: Is there any learning support at Ritsumeikan University for obtaining a high language proficiency test score?

Answer:
We encourage you to make the most of the opportunities available on campus such as CLA courses offered by the Language Education Center/ Center for Language Acquisition and Foreign Language Communication Rooms. In addition, the Beyond Borders Plaza (BBP) has a support desk where students can consult with foreign language teachers regarding language learning generally. Please feel free to make use of these resources.
