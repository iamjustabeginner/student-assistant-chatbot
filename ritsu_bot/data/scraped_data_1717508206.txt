Generally, when you sign an apartment rental contract in Japan, a co-signer is required. When a co-signer is not available, you must use the services of a guarantor company. In order to ensure that our students can smoothly complete their contracts and begin their studies worry free, we recommend you use the guarantor company below. If you are an international student of Ritsumeikan University (regardless of visa status), you are eligible to utilize the guarantor company’s housing co-sign guarantee at a specially discounted rate.<br><br></p><h4 class="mod-title type4">Global Trust Networks (GTN)</h4><ul><li>English homepage: <a class=blank href=http://www.gtn.co.jp/en/ target=_blank>http://www.gtn.co.jp/en/<img alt="New window" src=/common/images_e/common/icon_blank_x2.png></a></li><li>Japanese homepage: <a class=blank href=http://www.gtn.co.jp/ target=_blank>http://www.gtn.co.jp/<img alt="New window" src=/common/images_e/common/icon_blank_x2.png></a> <br>*The homepage is also available in Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese.</li><h5 class="mod-title type5">Guarantor Services:</h5><ol><li>Support in English, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Nepali.</li><li>You do not have to find anyone to co-sign for your housing.<br>You can enjoy the company’s co-sign guarantee simply by designating both an emergency contact person in your home country (family), and an emergency contact here in Japan (any nationality).</li><li>Support for your daily life. <br>Call the help line for assistance when you move in and need to complete your utility contracts - electric, gas, and water.
