<div class=article-body><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Because “Student” statuses of residence lose their validity upon graduation or completion of studies, in order for international students who were studying at Ritsumeikan University to continue to stay in Japan, it is necessary to change their status of residence.</span></p><p>As indicated on the Immigration Services Agency’s website below, for those students who have been searching for a job but their employer is not decided by graduation, and wish to continue job hunting after graduation, it is possible to change to a “Designated Activities” status of residence (valid for 6 months) as long as certain requirements are met. In order to apply to change to a “Designated Activities” status of residence at the Immigration Bureau, a letter of recommendation from Ritsumeikan University is required.<br>＜Immigration Services Agency Website＞</p><p><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/status/designatedactivities14.html?hl=en">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/status/designatedactivities14.html?hl=en</a></p><p> </p><p>This status is only for <strong>degree-seeking students</strong> who will graduate from Ritsumeikan University. Non-Degree students, auditing students, exchange students, and research students cannot apply for this status.</p><p>Ritsumeikan University holds application periods twice per year for the issuance of these letters of recommendation. International students from whom the International Center receives an application will undergo a evaluation of their studies, lifestyle condition, job hunting activities up to the time of application, motivation for the field/industry of interest, and ability to pay expenses, etc. A letter of recommendation will be issued to those students for whom it is deemed appropriate. For the screening, applicants will complete an online form, after which the International Center will conduct a document review.</p><p> </p><p>An information session on the issuance of these letters of recommendation will be held on the following date. The information session will be held only once and will be conducted online in both English and Japanese. Please be sure to pre-register at the ZOOM link below.</p><p> </p><p><strong>＜Information Session on the Issuance of “Designated Activities” Letters of Recommendation (to be issued in March 2024)＞</strong></p><p><strong>Wednesday, January 31, 2024, 1:00 pm (about 90 minutes)　</strong><span class=wysiwyg-color-blue90>It has ended</span></p><p> </p><p>*If for circumstances beyond your control, you are unable to attend the information session, the information session materials will be uploaded on this page, so please be sure to read them thoroughly.</p><p> </p><p>*Those students who have decided on a career path must report their decision to the Career Center.</p><p>*Students who are graduating in September 2024 are welcome to participate in this information session, but are not allowed to apply during this application period.  Students graduating in September 2024 who would like to request the issuance of a letter of recommendation should apply during the next application period (to be announced at a later time on the portal site)<a name=_Hlk139997753></a></p><p> </p><p>＜Information Session Documents＞<span class=wysiwyg-color-red>★2/2 Up</span></p><table border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="width: 100%; height: 110px;"><tbody><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 5%; height: 22px;"> </td><td class=wysiwyg-text-align-center style="width: 71.2857%; height: 22px;">Department in charge</td><td class=wysiwyg-text-align-center style="width: 23.5714%; height: 22px;">Documents</td></tr><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 5%; height: 22px;">①</td><td style="width: 71.2857%; height: 22px;">【International Center】Application Guideline for Designated Activity</td><td style="width: 23.5714%; height: 22px;"><a href=/hc/article_attachments/25852849800211><span class=wysiwyg-font-size-large>Document①</span></a></td></tr><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 5%; height: 22px;">②</td><td style="width: 71.2857%; height: 22px;">【Career Center 】Support for Job Hunting</td><td style="width: 23.5714%; height: 22px;"><span class=wysiwyg-font-size-large><a href=/hc/article_attachments/25852849800211>Document</a><a href=/hc/article_attachments/25852836224659>②</a></span></td></tr><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 5%; height: 22px;">③</td><td style="width: 71.2857%; height: 22px;">【Osaka Employment Service Center for Foreigner】Support for Job Hunting</td><td style="width: 23.5714%; height: 22px;"><span class=wysiwyg-font-size-large><a href=/hc/article_attachments/25852849800211>Document</a><a href=/hc/article_attachments/25853473758995>③</a></span></td></tr><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 5%; height: 22px;">④</td><td style="width: 71.2857%; height: 22px;">【Osaka Immigration Bureau】Status of residence to work in Japan</td><td style="width: 23.5714%; height: 22px;"><span class=wysiwyg-font-size-large><a href=/hc/article_attachments/25852849800211>Document</a><a href=/hc/article_attachments/25853504189331>④</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>＜ＵＲＬ for application＞<span class=wysiwyg-color-red>★Will be released starting March 1</span></p><p> For application details, please check document ① in the table.</p><p> </p><table border=1 style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 66px;"><tbody><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 8.47616%; height: 22px;">No.</td><td style="width: 47.3333%; height: 22px;">Required Documents</td><td style="width: 44.1904%; height: 22px;">Where to Submit</td></tr><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 8.47616%; height: 22px;">１</td><td style="width: 47.3333%; height: 22px;"><p>Application Form (3/1 (Fri.) - 4/30 (Tues.))</p><p>★You must register as a user to be able to apply.
