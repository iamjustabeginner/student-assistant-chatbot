However, please apply for a special arrangement. Class instructors shall do the following as far as possible, so that the student can smoothly learn what they should study.</p><ul class=u-markList><li><span class=mark>・</span>Handouts distributed in class</li><li><span class=mark>・</span>Information on what was covered in class as well as the key points in class</li><li><span class=mark>・</span>Instructions on self-study content</li><li><span class=mark>・</span>Academic guidance and support relating to classes such as making substitute arrangements for reports or small quizzes that the student missed.</li></ul><p>As for 2) attendance or non-attendance in the event of a natural disaster, the principle is that each student makes a decision giving priority to safety, depending on the situation of his/her area of residence and commuting area, even if classes are not cancelled at the campus or the entire university. Based on this perspective, in the case of unavoidable non-attendance due to natural disasters, the University asks class instructors to make sure that such non-attendance does not cause disadvantage in academic assessment, in addition to the above arrangements.</p><p>Please follow the following procedure when requesting a special arrangement:</p><h4>In the case of absence due to bereavement</h4><p>Please submit an official certificate of death (a death certificate etc., or a thank you letter for attending a funeral is also possible) to the class instructor.</p><!-- #cons03e --><section class="section u-mt40" id=cons03e><h4>In the case of absence due to natural disasters</h4><p>Please check acceptance of the special arrangements with regard to classes in the following order. <br><span class=u-note>*If there is any instructions in class or on manaba+R on how to submit the form other than the following, please follow the instruction and apply in accordance with its contents.</span></p><ul class="u-markList u-mb40"><li><span class=mark>1.</span>First, check “Surveys” for the relevant subject in the course on manaba+R to see if there is a survey for the relevant natural disasters. <br><span class=u-note>* Acceptance of an application via manaba＋R may take time before being posted, because this method is an emergency response due to natural disasters.
