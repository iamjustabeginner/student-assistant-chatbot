              Based on the provided context, it seems that Ritsumeikan University uses a unique conversion method to calculate GPA. According to the method, GPA is calculated as follows:

(5 x # of A credits) + (4 x # of A- credits) + (3 x # of B credits) + (2 x # of C credits)

Where A, A-, B, and C are the grades earned by the student.

To convert your grades to GPA, you can follow these steps:

1. Count the number of credits for each grade (A, A-, B, C, and F).
2. Multiply the number of credits for each grade by the corresponding point value (5 for A, 4 for A-, 3 for B, 2 for C, and 0 for F).
3. Add up the total points.
4. Divide the total points by the total number of registered credits.

For example, if you have 10 credits of A, 5 credits of A-, 3 credits of B, and 2 credits of C, your GPA would be:

(5 x 10) + (4 x 5) + (3 x 3) + (2 x 2) = 50 + 20 + 9 + 4 = 83

Total registered credits = 10 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 20

GPA = 83 / 20 = 4.15

Please note that this is a simplified example and actual GPA calculation may vary depending on the specific courses and grades you have earned. It's recommended to consult with the university's administrative office or academic advisor for more accurate GPA calculation."
